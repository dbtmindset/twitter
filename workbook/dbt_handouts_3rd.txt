An assumption is a belief that cannot be proved
People are doing the best they can
All people at any given point in time are doing the best they can
The common characteristic of all people is that they want to improve their lives and be happy
People need to do better try harder and be more motivated to change
The fact that people are doing the best they can and want to do even better does not mean
People may not have caused all of our own problems but they have to solve them
People have to change their own behavioral responses and alter their environment for their life
New behavior has to be learned in all relevant contexts
New behavioral skills have to be practiced in the situations where the skills are needed not just
All behaviors actions thoughts emotions are caused
There is always a cause or set of causes for our actions thoughts and emotions even if we do
Figuring out and changing the causes of behavior work better than judging and blaming
Judging and blaming are easier but if we want to create change in the world we have to
But trying harder and being more motivated may not be needed if progress is steady and at a realistic rate of improvement
Parents and caregivers must assist children in this task

Why do I have so much trouble controlling
It’s simply how some people are born
They are more sensitive to emotional stimuli they can detect subtle
They experience emotions much more often than others
Their emotions seem to hit for no reason from out of the blue
They have more intense emotions
Their emotions hit like a ton of bricks
And their emotions are long­lasting
Regulating action is harder for some than for others
They find it very hard to restrain impulsive behaviors
Often without thinking they do things that get them in trouble
Sometimes their behavior seems to come out of nowhere
They find it very hard to be effective
Their moods get in the way of organizing to achieve their goals
They cannot control behaviors linked to their moods

An invalidating environment doesn’t seem to understand your emotions
It tells you your emotions are invalid weird wrong or bad
It often ignores your emotional reactions and does nothing to help you
People who invalidate are often doing the best they can
They may not know how to validate or how important it is to validate or
They may be under high stress or time pressure or they may have too
There may be just a poor fit between you and your social environment
You may be a tulip in a rose garden
If people give in when you get out of control it will be hard for you to get in
If others command you to change but don’t coach you on how to do this
It’s the transactions that count
Biology and the social environment influence the person
The person reciprocates and influences his or her social environment
The social environment reciprocates and influences the person
And so on and on and on

Myths in the Way of Interpersonal Effectiveness
Myths in the Way of Objectives Effectiveness
I don’t deserve to get what I want or need
If I make a request this will show that I am a very weak person
I have to know whether a person is going to say yes before I make a request
If I ask for something or say no I can’t stand it if someone gets upset with me
If they say no it will kill me
Making requests is a really pushy bad self­centered selfish etc
Saying no to a request is always a selfish thing to do
I should be willing to sacrifice my own needs for others
I must be really inadequate if I can’t fix this myself
Obviously the problem is just in my head
If I don’t have what I want or need it doesn’t make any difference I don’t care really
Skillfulness is a sign of weakness
Myths in the Way of Relationship and Self­Respect Effectiveness
I shouldn’t have to ask say no they should know what I want and do it
They should have known that their behavior would hurt my feelings I shouldn’t have to tell
I shouldn’t have to negotiate or work at getting what I want
Other people should be willing to do more for my needs
Other people should like approve of and support me
They don’t deserve my being skillful or treating them well
Getting what I want when I want it is most important
I shouldn’t be fair kind courteous or respectful if others are not so toward me
Revenge will feel so good it will be worth any negative consequences
Getting what I want is more important than how I get it the ends really do justify the means

Getting What You Want DEAR MAN
A way to remember these skills is to remember the term DEAR MAN
Describe the current situation if necessary
Tell the person exactly what you are reacting to
“You told me you would be home by dinner but you didn’t get here until 11”
Express your feelings and opinions about the situation
Don’t assume that the other person knows how you feel
“When you come home so late I start worrying about you”
Use phrases such as “I want” instead of “You should” “I don’t want”
Assert yourself by asking for what you want or saying no clearly
Do not assume that others will figure out what you want
Remember that others cannot read your mind
“I would really like it if you would call me when you are going to be late”
Reinforce reward the person ahead of time so to speak
If necessary also clarify the negative consequences of not getting
“I would be so relieved and a lot easier to live with if you do that”

When other people have really good skills themselves and keep refusing your legitimate requests
If the “broken record” and ignoring don’t work make a
Express feelings or opinions about the interaction
For instance in the middle of an
Example “I am sorry I cannot do what you want but I’m finding it hard to keep discussing it”
Not “I hate you” “Every time we talk about this you get defensive” “Stop patronizing me”
Assert wishes in the situation
When another person is pestering you you can ask him
When a person is refusing a request you can suggest that you put the
Give the other person a chance to think about it
When you are saying no to someone who keeps asking or when someone won’t
When trying to get someone to do something for you you can suggest that

Strategies for Decreasing or Stopping
Extinction  Stopping an ongoing reinforcement of behavior
Extinction leads first to a burst of behavior and then to a decrease in behavior
Satiation  Providing relief or what is wanted before the behavior occurs
Satiation reduces motivation for behavior and thus decreases its frequency
Behavior is decreased by consequences the person dislikes or will work to avoid
Behavior is decreased by consequences that stop or reduce something positive
Behavior is decreased when something the person wants is withheld until harmful effects of
Be sure that punishment is specific is time­limited and fits the “crime”
Avoid a punitive tone let the consequence do the work
If a natural punishment occurs don’t undo it
Be sure to reinforce alternative behavior to replace behavior you want stopped
Extinction and punishment weaken or suppress behavior but do not eliminate it
Extinction and punishment do not teach new behavior
To keep a behavior from resurfacing reinforce an alternative behavior
Punishment leads to avoidance of the person punishing

What Emotions Do for You
Emotions Motivate and Organize Us for Action
Emotions motivate our behavior
Emotions prepare us for action
The action urge of specific emotions is often “hardwired” in biology
Emotions save time in getting us to act in important situations
Emotions can be especially important when we don’t have time to think things through
Strong emotions help us overcome obstacles—in our minds and in the environment
Emotions Communicate to and Influence Others
Facial expressions are hardwired aspects of emotions
Facial expressions communicate faster than words
Our body language and voice tone can also be hardwired
Like it or not they also communicate our emotions to others
When it is important to communicate to others or send them a message
Whether we intend it or not our communication of emotions influences others
Emotional reactions can give us important information about a situation
Emotions can be signals or alarms that something is happening
Gut feelings can be like intuition—a response to something important about the situation
This can be helpful if our emotions get us to check out the facts
Caution Sometimes we treat emotions as if they are facts about the world The stronger
If we assume that our emotions represent facts about the world we may use them to justify
This can be trouble if our emotions get us to ignore the facts

What Makes It Hard to Regulate Your Emotions
Biological factors can make emotion regulation harder
You don’t know what to do to regulate your emotions
Your environment reinforces you when you are highly emotional
Your current mood controls what you do instead of your Wise Mind
You don’t really want to put in time and effort to regulate your emotions
You can’t follow skills instructions or figure out what to do
Myths eg mistaken beliefs about emotions get in the way of your
Myths that emotions are bad or weak lead to avoiding emotions
Myths that extreme emotions are necessary or are part of who you are

There is a right way to feel in every situation
Letting others know that I am feeling bad is a weakness
Negative feelings are bad and destructive
Being emotional means being out of control
All painful emotions are a result of a bad attitude
If others don’t approve of my feelings I obviously shouldn’t feel the way I do
Other people are the best judges of how I am feeling
Painful emotions are not important and should be ignored
Extreme emotions get you a lot further than trying to regulate your emotions
It is inauthentic to try to change my emotions
Emotional truth is what counts not factual truth
People should do whatever they feel like doing
Acting on your emotions is the mark of a truly free individual
My emotions are who I am
My emotions are why people love me
Emotions can just happen for no reason
Emotions should always be trusted
