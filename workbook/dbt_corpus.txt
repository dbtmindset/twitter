Give helpful noncritical feedback when asked
Are willing to accept help from a person they ask or call for help
An assumption is a belief that cannot be proved
People are doing the best they can
All people at any given point in time are doing the best they can
The common characteristic of all people is that they want to improve their lives and be happy
People need to do better try harder and be more motivated to change
The fact that people are doing the best they can and want to do even better does not mean
People may not have caused all of our own problems but they have to solve them
People have to change their own behavioral responses and alter their environment for their life
New behavior has to be learned in all relevant contexts
New behavioral skills have to be practiced in the situations where the skills are needed not just
All behaviors actions thoughts emotions are caused
There is always a cause or set of causes for our actions thoughts and emotions even if we do
Figuring out and changing the causes of behavior work better than judging and blaming

But trying harder and being more motivated may not be needed if progress is steady and at a realistic rate of improvement
Parents and caregivers must assist children in this task

Why do I have so much trouble controlling
It’s simply how some people are born
They are more sensitive to emotional stimuli they can detect subtle
They experience emotions much more often than others
Their emotions seem to hit for no reason from out of the blue
They have more intense emotions
Their emotions hit like a ton of bricks
And their emotions are long­lasting
Regulating action is harder for some than for others
They find it very hard to restrain impulsive behaviors
Often without thinking they do things that get them in trouble
Sometimes their behavior seems to come out of nowhere
They find it very hard to be effective
Their moods get in the way of organizing to achieve their goals
They cannot control behaviors linked to their moods

An invalidating environment doesn’t seem to understand your emotions
It tells you your emotions are invalid weird wrong or bad
It often ignores your emotional reactions and does nothing to help you
People who invalidate are often doing the best they can
They may not know how to validate or how important it is to validate or
They may be under high stress or time pressure or they may have too
There may be just a poor fit between you and your social environment
You may be a tulip in a rose garden
If people give in when you get out of control it will be hard for you to get in
If others command you to change but don’t coach you on how to do this
It’s the transactions that count
Biology and the social environment influence the person
The person reciprocates and influences his or her social environment
The social environment reciprocates and influences the person

Myths in the Way of Interpersonal Effectiveness
Myths in the Way of Objectives Effectiveness
I don’t deserve to get what I want or need
If I make a request this will show that I am a very weak person
I have to know whether a person is going to say yes before I make a request
If I ask for something or say no I can’t stand it if someone gets upset with me
If they say no it will kill me
Making requests is a really pushy bad self­centered selfish etc
Saying no to a request is always a selfish thing to do
I should be willing to sacrifice my own needs for others
I must be really inadequate if I can’t fix this myself
Obviously the problem is just in my head
If I don’t have what I want or need it doesn’t make any difference I don’t care really
Skillfulness is a sign of weakness
Myths in the Way of Relationship and Self­Respect Effectiveness
I shouldn’t have to ask say no they should know what I want and do it
They should have known that their behavior would hurt my feelings I shouldn’t have to tell
I shouldn’t have to negotiate or work at getting what I want
Other people should be willing to do more for my needs
Other people should like approve of and support me
They don’t deserve my being skillful or treating them well
Getting what I want when I want it is most important
I shouldn’t be fair kind courteous or respectful if others are not so toward me
Revenge will feel so good it will be worth any negative consequences
Getting what I want is more important than how I get it the ends really do justify the means

Getting What You Want DEAR MAN
A way to remember these skills is to remember the term DEAR MAN
Describe the current situation if necessary
Tell the person exactly what you are reacting to
“You told me you would be home by dinner but you didn’t get here until 11”
Express your feelings and opinions about the situation
Don’t assume that the other person knows how you feel
“When you come home so late I start worrying about you”
Use phrases such as “I want” instead of “You should” “I don’t want”
Assert yourself by asking for what you want or saying no clearly
Do not assume that others will figure out what you want
Remember that others cannot read your mind
“I would really like it if you would call me when you are going to be late”
Reinforce reward the person ahead of time so to speak
If necessary also clarify the negative consequences of not getting
“I would be so relieved and a lot easier to live with if you do that”

When other people have really good skills themselves and keep refusing your legitimate requests
If the “broken record” and ignoring don’t work make a
Express feelings or opinions about the interaction
For instance in the middle of an
Example “I am sorry I cannot do what you want but I’m finding it hard to keep discussing it”
Not “I hate you” “Every time we talk about this you get defensive” “Stop patronizing me”
Assert wishes in the situation
When another person is pestering you you can ask him
When a person is refusing a request you can suggest that you put the
Give the other person a chance to think about it
When you are saying no to someone who keeps asking or when someone won’t

What Emotions Do for You
Emotions Motivate and Organize Us for Action
Emotions motivate our behavior
Emotions prepare us for action
The action urge of specific emotions is often “hardwired” in biology
Emotions save time in getting us to act in important situations
Emotions can be especially important when we don’t have time to think things through
Strong emotions help us overcome obstacles—in our minds and in the environment
Emotions Communicate to and Influence Others
Facial expressions are hardwired aspects of emotions
Facial expressions communicate faster than words
Our body language and voice tone can also be hardwired
Like it or not they also communicate our emotions to others
When it is important to communicate to others or send them a message
Whether we intend it or not our communication of emotions influences others
Emotional reactions can give us important information about a situation
Emotions can be signals or alarms that something is happening
Gut feelings can be like intuition—a response to something important about the situation
This can be helpful if our emotions get us to check out the facts
Caution Sometimes we treat emotions as if they are facts about the world The stronger
If we assume that our emotions represent facts about the world we may use them to justify
This can be trouble if our emotions get us to ignore the facts

What Makes It Hard to Regulate Your Emotions
Biological factors can make emotion regulation harder
You don’t know what to do to regulate your emotions
Your environment reinforces you when you are highly emotional
Your current mood controls what you do instead of your Wise Mind
You don’t really want to put in time and effort to regulate your emotions
You can’t follow skills instructions or figure out what to do
Myths eg mistaken beliefs about emotions get in the way of your
Myths that emotions are bad or weak lead to avoiding emotions
Myths that extreme emotions are necessary or are part of who you are

There is a right way to feel in every situation
Letting others know that I am feeling bad is a weakness
Negative feelings are bad and destructive
Being emotional means being out of control
All painful emotions are a result of a bad attitude
If others don’t approve of my feelings I obviously shouldn’t feel the way I do
Other people are the best judges of how I am feeling
Painful emotions are not important and should be ignored
Extreme emotions get you a lot further than trying to regulate your emotions
It is inauthentic to try to change my emotions
Emotional truth is what counts not factual truth
People should do whatever they feel like doing
Acting on your emotions is the mark of a truly free individual
My emotions are who I am
My emotions are why people love me
Emotions can just happen for no reason
Emotions should always be trusted

Either it can be physical

Their distress comes on more quickly and feels like an
Often these situations feel like they’ll never end and the people experiencing them don’t know how to cope with the severity of their pain
For the purposes of this
People struggling with overwhelming emotions often deal with their pain in very unhealthy
Here’s a list of some common coping strategies used by people dealing with this problem
You isolate yourself from other people to avoid distressing situations
You make yourself feel numb with alcohol or drugs
All of these strategies are paths to even deeper emotional pain because even the strategies that offer temporary relief will only cause you more suffering in the future

The second group of distress tolerance skills you’ll learn in this chapter are self­soothing
It’s often necessary to soothe yourself before you face the
In situations like these distress tolerance skills are similar to refilling the gas
Selfsoothing is meant to bring you some amount of peace
They’ll help you learn to treat yourself compassionately
Many people with overwhelming emotions have been abused or neglected as children
As a result they were taught more about how to hurt than to help themselves
HOW TO USE THIS CHAPTER
As you read the following groups of skills mark the ones that are helpful to you
Then in the next chapter you’ll learn more advanced distress tolerance skills
Increasing your ability to tolerate distress starts with a change in your attitude
This is a new way of looking at your life
But for now it will be sufficient to cover this concept briefly
Often when a person is in pain his or her first reaction is to get angry or upset or to blame
But unfortunately no matter who you blame for
In fact in some cases the angrier
Getting angry or upset over a situation also stops you from seeing what is really happening
Have you ever heard the expression “being blinded by rage”
This often happens to people with
Criticizing yourself all the time or being overly judgmental of a situation is
By doing this you’re missing the details and not seeing everything as it really is
Being overly critical about a situation prevents you from taking steps to change that situation
You can’t change the past
And if you spend your time fighting the past—wishfully thinking
So to review—being overly judgmental of a situation or overly critical of yourself often leads
Obviously getting angry upset or critical doesn’t
So what else can you do
The other option which radical acceptance suggests is to acknowledge your present situation
Instead try to recognize that your
So a few days later you went to the bookstore and bought this book
Now you are up to the words you see here
Denying this chain of events does nothing to
Trying to fight this moment or say that it shouldn’t be only
Radical acceptance means looking at yourself and the situation
Keep in mind that radical acceptance does not mean that you condone or agree with bad
But it does mean that you stop trying to change what’s happened by getting
For example if you’re in an abusive relationship and you need to
Don’t waste your time and continue to suffer by blaming yourself or the other
Refocus your attention on what you can do now
To help you begin using radical acceptance it’s often helpful to use a coping statement to
Below are a few examples and spaces to create your own
Then in the next exercise you’ll begin using the
“This is the way it has to be”
“All the events have led up to now”
“I can’t change what’s already happened”
“It’s no use fighting the past”
“Fighting the past only blinds me to my present”
“The present is the only moment I have control over”
“It’s a waste of time to fight what’s already occurred”
“The present moment is perfect even if I don’t like what’s happening”
“This moment is exactly as it should be given what’s happened before it”
“This moment is the result of over a million other decisions”
Now using the coping statements that you checked begin radically accepting different moments
Naturally it will be difficult to accept very painful situations
Check  the ones you’re willing to do
Then use your coping statements to radically accept the situation
Read a controversial story in the newspaper without being judgmental about what has
The next time you get caught in heavy traffic wait without being critical
Watch the world news on television without being critical of what’s happening
Listen to a news story or a political commentary on the radio without being
One of the most important purposes of dialectical behavior therapy is to help you stop engaging in
No one can deny the amount of pain you are in when you engage in one of these behaviors
Some people with overwhelming emotions say that selfinjury temporarily relieves them of some of
This might be true but it’s also true that these actions can cause serious
Think about all the pain you’ve already been through in your life
Think about all the people
Does it make sense to continue
Doesn’t it make more sense to start healing yourself
If you really want to recover from the pain you’ve already experienced stopping
This can be very hard to do
However these types of selfdestructive actions are highly dangerous and certainly
Here are some safer actions that you can use to distract yourself from your selfdestructive ­emotions
Instead of hurting yourself hold an ice cube in one hand and squeeze it
The sensation from the cold ice is numbing and very distracting
Write on yourself with a red felttip marker instead of cutting
Use red paint or nail polish to make it look like you’re bleeding
If you need to make it even more distracting squeeze an
Snap a rubber band on your wrist each time you feel like hurting yourself
Dig your fingernails into your arm without breaking the skin
Draw faces of people you hate on balloons and then pop them
Write letters to people you hate or to people who have hurt you
Then throw the letters away or save
Throw foam balls rolledup socks or pillows against the wall as hard as you can
Scream as loud as you can into a pillow or scream some place where you won’t draw
Stick pins in a voodoo doll instead of hurting yourself
You can make a voodoo doll
Or you can buy a doll
Buy one that’s soft and easy

DISTRACT YOURSELF BY PAYING ATTENTION
Another great way to distract yourself from pain is to put your attention on someone else
Check  the ones you’re willing to do and then add any activities that you
Do something for someone else
Ask your parents grandparents or siblings if you can help them with something
Call up someone you know and offer
Go outside and give money to the first needy person you
If you can plan ahead for moments like these when you’re overwhelmed with
Join a local political activities group
Take your attention off yourself
Go to a local store shopping center bookstore or park
Just sit and watch other people or walk around among them
Count the number of buttons
Observe as many details about these other people as
Count the number of people with blue eyes versus the number of people with
When your thinking returns to your own pain refocus on the details of
Think of someone you care about
Keep a picture of them in your wallet or in your
This could be your husband wife parent boyfriend girlfriend children or
It could even be a movie star an athlete or
Then when you’re feeling distressed take out the picture
What would they say to
Imagine them saying those words to you
Here’s an example of distracting yourself by paying attention to someone else
Very quickly Louis became overwhelmed by sadness
He sat down and started to talk to his mother as if
He asked for strength and guidance to handle the situation with Roger
Then he imagined what she would say to him and he started to feel better
The human brain is a wonderful thoughtproducing machine
It turns out millions of thoughts
Most of the time this makes our lives much easier
But unfortunately we can’t fully

Try to block the character from your thoughts
It’s impossible not to think
In fact the harder you try not to think about it the more power you give to
It’s almost as if the harder
This is why forcing yourself
It’s also why you can’t simply force
So instead of trying to force yourself to forget a memory or thought try to distract your
Create sexual fantasies involving you
Try to think of as many
What happens that’s so exciting
Observe the flowers trees sky and
Observe any animals that are around
Or if you live in a city without much nature around you either
How would you do it
What would people say to you
What does this person say to you
Why does this person’s opinion matter
What would you do afterwards
Imagine the words calming and soothing
Use imagery such as a white light coming down from heaven or the universe
Here’s an example of using distracting thoughts
Joel was in a bad relationship that often
She was always criticizing him and telling
When these memories overwhelmed him Joel never knew what to do
But after creating a distraction
The next time he had memories of his mother berating him he
Then he started to imagine himself as a child confronting his
He told her all the things he wished he could have said to her
He told her she was wrong and that she should stop criticizing him
He had escaped the cycle of letting his painful emotions overwhelm him
Sometimes the best thing that you can do is leave
Remember if you’re already overwhelmed
Just walk away if that’s the best you can do
Here’s an example of leaving to distract yourself
Anna was in a large department store shopping for a blouse
She wanted one of the clerks to help her find her size but the store clerk was
Anna waited as long as she could and kept trying to get the clerk’s
Anna recognized that she was getting angry very quickly
She didn’t know what else to do
In the past she would have

When you inevitably start thinking about whatever it is that’s causing you pain return
If you’re too distracted by your emotions simply count the sounds
This will take your attention outside of yourself
Count or subtract by increments of seven
For example start with one hundred and
Now take that answer and subtract seven more

Now with your eyes closed imagine that you enter your safe place using all of your senses to ground
First look around using your imaginary sense of sight
What does this place look like
Is it sunny or cloudy
Are you alone or are there other people or animals
If you’re outside look up and notice the sky
Look out at the horizon
Is the room light or dark
Then continue looking for a few seconds using your imaginary sense of sight
Next use your imaginary sense of hearing
Do you hear other people or animals
Do you hear the wind or the ocean
Choose something soothing to hear
Then use your imaginary sense of smell
If you’re inside what does it smell like
Do you have a fire burning that you can smell
Or if you’re outside can you smell the air the grass
Choose to smell something soothing in your scene

Can you feel the wind
Can you feel something you’re touching in the scene
Choose to touch something soothing in your scene
Then take a few seconds to use your imaginary sense

Now with your eyes still closed imagine that a white beam of light shines down from the sky like
Notice how warm and soothing the light makes
This could be a light from God the universe or whatever power makes you feel comfortable

Maybe you have a job that you don’t like and you wonder
Perhaps you’re going to school and you don’t remember what your
Or maybe you’re in a relationship that isn’t fulfilling and you wonder why you keep
In cases like these remembering what you value can help you tolerate stressful situations and also help you create a more fulfilling life for yourself
This first exercise will ask you to identify how you value ten different components of your life

LIVE IN THE PRESENT MOMENT
We all do it occasionally but some people do it more often than others
People who time travel spend a large portion of each day thinking about all the things they
As a result that’s where they live in the past or in the future
Are you thinking of something else
Are you thinking of something
What does your body feel
Do you notice any spots of tension or physical pain
Are you taking full deep breaths or are you breathing very shallowly
Often we don’t pay attention to what’s happening to us
We don’t pay attention to what
And to make it even more problematic we often try to do more than one
But even worse not living in the present moment can also make life more painful
Obviously both types of time traveling
In chapters 3 through 5 on mindfulness skills you’ll learn advanced skills to help you stay in
Exercise “Where Are You Now”
The next time you’re in a distressing situation ask yourself the following questions
Where am I right now
Am I time traveling in the future worrying about something that might happen
Am I time traveling in the past reviewing mistakes reliving bad experiences or
Or am I in the present really paying attention to what I’m doing thinking and
If you’re not in the present moment refocus your attention on what’s happening to you now

Now as you continue to
Listen to any sounds you hear outside your home inside your home and inside

Try this exercise for five minutes and
A variation of this listening exercise will help you stay focused on the present moment while
Sometimes this can snap you out of your
Now continue to listen and if your mind begins to wander again do the same
Another exercise that will help you stay focused in the present moment is breathing
Think about it who ever taught you how

Everyone knows that we breathe air to take in oxygen
But how much of the air you breathe is actually oxygen—100 percent 75 percent

Radical acceptance is one of the hardest skills in this chapter to master because it will
However it’s also one of the most
Radical acceptance means that you accept something
For example radically accepting the present moment means that
Imagine that each moment of your life is connected like a line of dominoes
But remember radically accepting something doesn’t mean that you give up and simply accept
Some situations in life are unjust such as when someone
But for other situations in life you share at least some responsibility
However many people struggling with overwhelming emotions often feel like life just “happens” to them not recognizing their

So she called John at the bar to tell him that
She promised and then John left taking the keys

Then she walked up to the bar found John’s car and
She would have broken the other windows too but the police
Needless to say neither Christine nor John gave any consideration to
Both of them were angry at each other and by acting
So how could this situation have occurred differently if radical acceptance had been used
Let’s consider the situation from Christine’s point of view
Instead of threatening to kill herself
Remember your strategy for dealing with distressing situations is to distract relax and cope
Christine could have screamed into a pillow and then gone outside for a long walk
Then after she’d cooled off a
What events led up to Christine’s situation
She and John had been behaving and
This night was nothing new
But she had come home
What role did Christine play in creating this situation
Instead of trying to cope with
What role did John play in creating this situation
John had an alcohol addiction that
This night he also didn’t
What does Christine have control of in this situation
She can end the relationship
What doesn’t Christine have control of in this situation
Ultimately it is John who has
Christine can’t make him stop drinking
She also doesn’t have control of how John chooses to behave toward her in this
What was Christine’s response to this situation
She tried to kill herself and then she
How did her response affect her own thoughts and feelings
Her actions made her feel
How did her response affect the thoughts and feelings of other people
John were arrested which made both of them feel worse than they already did
How could Christine have changed her response to this situation so that it led to less
She could have used other distress tolerance skills
She could also have used radical acceptance to
How could the situation have occurred differently if Christine had decided to radically accept the situation
Now answer the same questions for yourself
Think of a distressing situation that you experienced
Then answer these questions that will help you radically accept the situation in a new
What happened in this distressing situation
What past events happened that led up to this situation
What role did you play in creating this situation
What roles did other people play in creating this situation
What do you have control of in this situation
What don’t you have control of in this situation
What was your response to this situation
How did your response affect your own thoughts and feelings
How did your response affect the thoughts and feelings of other people
How could you have changed your response to this situation so that it led to less
How could the situation have occurred differently if you had decided to radically
It’s very important to remember that radical acceptance also applies to accepting yourself
Or to put it another way radically accepting yourself means loving yourself just the way you are
Finding the goodness inside of yourself might be a
As a result they overlook their good qualities and add more pain to their lives
This is why radically accepting yourself
To begin building a healthier selfimage many people find it helpful to use selfaffirming statements
The purpose of these statements is to remind yourself of the good qualities you possess in
Here are some examples of selfaffirming statements
Check  the ones you’re willing to
“I might have some faults but I’m still a good person”
“I care about myself and other people”
“I accept who I am”
“I’m a good person not a mistake”
“I’m good and nobody’s perfect”
“I embrace both my good and bad qualities”
“Today I take responsibility for everything I do and say”
“I’m becoming a better person every day”
“I’m a sensitive person who experiences the world differently”
“I’m a sensitive person with rich emotional experiences”
“Each day I do the best I can”
“Even though bad things happened to me in the past I’m still a good person”
“Even though I’ve made mistakes in the past I’m still a good person”
“I’m here for a reason”
“There’s a purpose to my life even though I might not always see it”
Some people find it helpful to write their selfaffirming statements on index cards and then
One woman wrote her statement on her bathroom mirror with
One man wrote his on a sticky
You can choose to remind yourself of your
But choose a technique that will remind you many
The more often you can see the statement the more it will help change
Now that you’re familiar with all the distress tolerance skills you can create new coping strategies
Often people with overwhelming emotions go through similar distressing situations over and over again
In this exercise you’ll identify what those past situations were
But as you’ll notice you’ve been given two different New Coping Strategies worksheets
For example when you’re alone and feel overwhelmed it might be most
Here’s an example of preparing for both kinds of situations
Carl identified a distressing situation that occurred when he was with someone else
Next Carl identified how he usually coped with that situation with his brother using his old
I think about all the times
I get cuts all over my face and arms
I feel horrible for days thinking
Under “New Coping Strategies” Carl wrote the most appropriate distress tolerance skills
He chose them from the skills he found helpful in the last two chapters
Use my new coping thought ‘I’m strong and I can deal with him’
But these coping strategies are probably different from the strategies he might choose when
So Carl also filled out the worksheet for coping with distressing situations when he’s alone
The old coping strategies that
I go to the bar and drink
I get into fights at the bar
Remember my connection to the
The same results can also benefit you if you
We won’t fight as much
I won’t eat as much
I think about all the
CREATE NEW COPING STRATEGIES FOR DISTRESSING
SITUATIONS WHEN YOU’RE WITH SOMEONE ELSE
CREATE NEW COPING STRATEGIES FOR
DISTRESSING SITUATIONS WHEN YOU’RE ALONE
I feel scared when I’m
I feel sick after smoking
I get into fights at the
Remember my connection to the universe
On each worksheet pick four distressing situations from the past and examine how you
Identify the unhealthy coping strategies you used and what the consequences
Then record which new distress tolerance skills
Review chapters 1 and 2
Consider these to be options for
If you write “Use a new coping thought” write what that thought is
“Take a timeout” include what you’re going to do
Be specific so you don’t forget in the future
Finally record what the healthier consequences would have been if you had used your new distress
Use the examples provided to guide you and make photocopies of the worksheets if you need
CREATE AN EMERGENCY COPING PLAN
Hopefully you’ve been practicing the new distress tolerance skills from chapters 1 and 2 and you
I’ll now have a good idea about which ones work best for you
Or maybe using the New Coping
I’ll Strategies worksheet in the last section helped you predict which ones are going to work best for
Now you’ll be ready for the next step which will help you create a personally tailored plan for
For situations when you’re with other people list four coping strategies that you think will
Again be specific and include as many details about that strategy as
Begin with your most effective strategy then the second most effective strategy and so
The plan is that you’ll try the first strategy to see if it helps you cope with the distressing situation then if it doesn’t you’ll move on to the next strategy and so on
Again refer to any distress
MY EMERGENCY COPING PLAN FOR DEALING WITH SITUATIONS
When I’m Upset and Dealing with Other People
MY EMERGENCY COPING PLAN FOR DEALING WITH SITUATIONS
When I’m Upset and Alone
Then when you’ve finished making both plans copy each of them on a single note card
This strategy will provide you with constant
Plus you won’t have to try to remember what to do the next time you’re
You can simply pull out your card and follow your own Emergency
Remember to practice your new distress tolerance skills as often as possible and don’t get frustrated
Learning new skills is hard and it often feels awkward
But anyone can learn these distress tolerance skills and they have already helped thousands of
An operational working definition of mindfulness is the awareness that emerges through
MINDFULNESS SKILLS WHAT ARE THEY
Mindfulness also known as meditation is a valuable skill that has been taught for thousands of
Beginning in the 1980s Jon
KabatZinn began using nonreligious mindfulness skills to help hospital patients cope with chronic
More recently similar mindfulness techniques were also integrated into
Studies have shown mindfulness skills to be effective at reducing the
So what exactly is mindfulness
One definition is offered above by mindfulness researcher Jon
But for the purposes of this book mindfulness is the ability to be aware of your thoughts
For example consider what’s happening to you right now
But at the same time you’re also breathing listening to the sounds around
It’s also possible that you’re aware of your emotional and physical states of being happy sad tired or excited
Maybe you’re even aware of bodily
That’s a lot to be aware of and right now you’re just reading
Imagine what’s happening to you when you’re doing other things in your life like talking
The truth is no one is 100 percent mindful all the
But the more mindful you learn to be the more control you will gain over your life
But remember time never stands still and each second of your life is different
In fact you are now different
The cells in your body are constantly
And lastly in order to be fully aware of your experiences in the present moment it’s necessary
As described in chapter 2 radical
But while they’re doing this their focus is no longer on what’s
As a result they live in a painful past
So to review mindfulness is the ability to be aware of your thoughts emotions physical
Obviously mindfulness is a skill that requires practice
Most people get distracted “zone out” or
As a result they then
While driving or traveling you don’t remember the experience or which roads you
While having a conversation you suddenly realize that you don’t know what the other
While having a conversation you’re already thinking about what you’re going to say
While walking into a room you suddenly forget what you came to get
After putting something down you can’t remember where you just put it
While taking a shower you’re already planning what you have to do later and then
While having sex you’re thinking about other things or other people
All of these examples are fairly harmless
But for people with overwhelming emotions being
Consider the example of Lee
One day a new employee whom Lee found attractive
The woman tried to be friendly and make
“She’s probably just stuck up like the rest of them” he thought
Why would she want to sit with me
It’s probably just a joke someone
The woman did her best to make small talk
She asked Lee how he liked working at the
After five minutes of unsuccessfully trying the woman finally stopped talking to Lee
WHY ARE MINDFULNESS SKILLS IMPORTANT
Now that you have a better idea of what mindfulness is—and isn’t—it’s probably easy to see why
But for the purposes of this workbook let’s be very clear about why you
Mindfulness skills will help you focus on one thing at a time in the present moment and
Mindfulness will help you learn to identify and separate judgmental thoughts from your
These judgmental thoughts often fuel your overwhelming emotions
Mindfulness will help you develop a skill that’s very important in dialectical behavior
Wise mind is the ability to make healthy decisions about your life based on both your rational thoughts and your emotions
For example you’ve probably noticed that it’s often difficult—or
Similarly it’s often difficult to make informed decisions when your thoughts are
Wise mind is a decisionmaking process that balances the reasoning of your thoughts with the needs of your emotions and it is a skill that will
Throughout this chapter and the next you’ll be presented with exercises to help you become more
This chapter will introduce you to beginning
Then in the next chapter you’ll be taught
In dialectical behavior therapy these are called “how” skills
The exercises in this chapter will teach you four “what” skills
To focus more fully on the present moment
To recognize and focus on your thoughts emotions and physical sensations
To focus on your momenttomoment stream of awareness
To separate your thoughts from your emotions and physical sensations
As you read the following exercises it’s important that you practice them in the order in
The exercises in this chapter are grouped according to the four “what”
Exercise Focus on a Single Minute
This is the first exercise that will help you focus more fully on the present moment
Its purpose is to help you become more mindful of your
For this exercise you’ll need a watch with a second hand or preferably a
Many people feel that time goes by very quickly
As a result they’re always in a rush to do
Unfortunately this just makes them more unmindful of what they’re doing in the present
Other people feel that time goes by very slowly
As a result they feel like they have more
To begin this exercise find a comfortable place to sit in a room where you won’t be disturbed for
Begin timing yourself with your watch or stopwatch
Then without counting the seconds or looking at the watch simply sit wherever you are
Note how much time really
Did you allow less than a full minute to pass
If so how long was it—a few seconds twenty
If it wasn’t a full minute consider how this affects you
If so what does the result of
Or did you allow more than a minute to pass
If so how long was it—oneandahalf minutes
If so consider how this affects you
Are you frequently late for appointments because
If so what does the result of this exercise
Whatever your results were one of the purposes of learning mindfulness skills is to help you
If you’d like return to this exercise in a few weeks after you’ve been practicing
Focusing on a single object is the second mindfulness skill that will help you concentrate more
Remember one of the biggest traps of being unmindful is that your
This exercise will help you focus your attention on a
The purpose of this exercise is to help you train your “mental muscle” This means
During this exercise you will eventually become distracted by your thoughts memories or
That’s okay this happens to everyone who does this exercise
Just notice when your mind wanders and return your focus
Pick a small object to focus on
Choose something that can rest on a table is safe to touch
It can be anything such as a pen a flower a watch a ring a cup
Don’t choose to focus on something that could hurt you or on a picture of
These will stir up too many emotions for you right now
Find a comfortable place to sit in a room where you won’t be disturbed for a few minutes and
Turn off any distracting sounds
Do this exercise once or twice a day for two
You can photocopy the instructions if you want extra copies to refer to or you can record
To begin sit comfortably and take a few slow deep breaths
Then without touching the object
Take your time exploring what it
Then try to imagine the different qualities that the object possesses
What does the surface of the object look like
Is it shiny or dull
Does it look smooth or rough
Does it look soft or hard
Does it have multiple colors or just one color
What else is unique about the way the object looks
Now hold the object in your hand or reach out and touch the
Begin noticing the different ways it feels
Is it smooth or is it rough
Does it have ridges or is it flat
Is it soft or is it hard
Is it bendable or is it rigid
Does the object have areas that feel different from each other
What does the temperature of the object feel like
If you can hold it in your hand notice how much it weighs
What else do you notice about the way it feels
Continue exploring the object with both your sight and your sense of touch
When your attention begins to wander return your focus to the object
This is the third exercise that will help you focus more fully on the present moment
Then you can either keep these
As with the other exercises in this chapter most likely your focus will begin to wander while
When you recognize that your focus is drifting gently return
To begin find a comfortable place to sit in a room where you won’t be disturbed for ten minutes
Turn off any distracting sounds
Take a few slow long breaths and then close your eyes
Whatever sensations you notice are okay
Slowly the band of light begins to descend around your head passing over the tops of
As it does become aware of any sensations you feel there even small sensations
Notice any muscle tension you may be feeling on the top of your head
As the band of light slowly descends over your nose mouth and chin continue to focus
Pay attention to the back of your head where you may be having sensations
Notice any sensations you may be feeling in your mouth on your tongue or on your
Continue to watch the band of light in your imagination descend around your neck and
Now the band widens and begins to move down your torso across the width of your
Notice any sensations muscle tension or tingling you might be feeling in your shoulders
Now become aware of your chest the middle of your back the side of your torso your
Again notice any tension or sensations no matter how small
As the band continues to move down your lower body become aware of any sensations
Be sure to pay attention to the backs of your legs and notice any feelings there
Continue to watch the band of light descend around your lower legs around your calves
Notice any feelings or tension you’re experiencing
Then as the band of light disappears after completing its descent take a few more slow long
Now that you’ve practiced being mindful of both an object outside of yourself and your internal
This is the first exercise that
This will be done by teaching you to shift your attention back and forth in a mindful focused
Read the instructions before beginning the exercise to familiarize yourself with the experience
Then you can either keep these instructions near you if you need to refer to them while
To begin find a comfortable place to sit in a room where you won’t be disturbed for ten minutes
Turn off any distracting sounds
Take a few slow long breaths and relax
Now keeping your eyes open focus your attention on an object in the room
Notice its shape and color
Imagine what that object would feel like if you could hold it
Describe the object silently to yourself being as descriptive as possible
If your focus begins to drift simply return your attention to the exercise
Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions
When you have finished describing the object return your focus to your body
Notice any physical sensations that you might be experiencing
Scan your body from your head to your feet
Take a minute to do this and keep breathing slow deep breaths
Now redirect your attention to your sense of hearing
Notice any sounds that you can hear
Take a minute to do
Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions
When you have finished listening to the sounds that you can notice return your focus to your
Again notice any physical sensations
Become aware of the weight of your body resting in the
Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor
Notice the weight of your head resting on top of
Notice in general how your body feels
If you become distracted by your thoughts just notice
Once again redirect your attention
This time put your focus on your sense of smell
If you don’t notice any smells just become aware of
Try your best to maintain
If you become distracted by any thoughts return your focus to your
Take a minute to do this and keep breathing
When you have finished using your sense of smell once again return your focus to your physical sensations
Notice any sensations that you might be feeling
Once again scan your body from your
Now finally redirect your attention to your sense of touch
Reach out with one of your hands to
Or if there is no object within reach touch the chair you’re sitting on
Notice what the object feels like
Notice if it’s smooth or rough
Notice if it’s pliable or
Notice if it’s soft or solid
Notice what the sensations feel like on the skin of your fingertips
When you’ve finished take three to five slow long breaths and return your focus to the room
Exercise Record Three Minutes of Thoughts
This is the second exercise that will help you recognize and focus on your thoughts emotions and
This will allow you to become more mindful of just how quickly your mind really
The instructions for this exercise are simple set a timer for three minutes and begin writing
But don’t try to record the thought word for
Just write down a word or two that represents the thought
See how many of your thoughts you can catch in three minutes no matter how small the
Even if you start thinking about this exercise write “exercise” Or if you start thinking about the paper you’re writing on write “paper” No one else ever has to see this record so be
When you’ve finished count the number of thoughts you had in three minutes and multiply
This is the third exercise that will help you recognize and focus on your thoughts emotions and
When distressing thoughts keep repeating it’s often easy to get “hooked” on them like a
With practice this skill will give you more
The object of this skill is to visualize your thoughts either as pictures or words harmlessly floating away from you without obsessing about them or analyzing them
Imagine sitting in a field watching your thoughts float away on clouds
Picture yourself sitting near a stream watching your thoughts float past on leaves
See your thoughts written in the sand and then watch the waves wash them
Envision yourself driving a car and see your thoughts pass by on billboards
See your thoughts leave your head and watch them sizzle in the flame of a
Imagine sitting beside a tree and watch your thoughts float down on leaves
Picture yourself standing in a room with two doors then watch your thoughts enter
If one of these ideas works for you that’s great
If not feel free to create your own
Let your thoughts be whatever they are
Read the instructions before beginning the exercise to familiarize yourself with the experience
If you feel more comfortable listening to the instructions use an audiorecording device to
But don’t expect to be able to sit still that long when you first start
To begin find a comfortable place to sit in a room where you won’t be disturbed for as long as
Turn off any distracting sounds
Take a few slow long breaths relax and close
Now in your imagination picture yourself in the scenario that you chose watching your thoughts
After you do start to become aware of the thoughts that you’re having
Start to observe the thoughts that are coming up whatever they are
Don’t try to stop your thoughts and
Just watch the thoughts arise and then using
Whatever the thought is big or small
Just continue to watch the thoughts arise and disappear
Use pictures to represent the thoughts or
Do your best to watch the thoughts arise and disappear without
If more than one thought comes up at the same time see them both arise and disappear
Continue to breathe and watch the thoughts come and go until your timer goes off
When you’ve finished take a few more slow long breaths and then slowly open your eyes and
This is the fourth exercise that will help you recognize and focus on your thoughts emotions and
So far the exercises in this chapter have helped you learn to be more mindful
This next exercise will help you become more mindful of
This exercise will ask you to choose an emotion and then
So to begin pick an emotion
It can be either a pleasant or an unpleasant emotion
If it is you should wait until you feel more in control of your emotions before
On the other hand if you can’t identify what you’re feeling now choose
For example if you got into a fight with
Maybe this situation made you feel angry hurt sad stupid or something else
Maybe someone recently gave you a gift
Your emotion would depend on how you felt about the gift
If the gift came from someone you don’t know very well you
Be specific about how you feel
To help you choose an emotion use this list of some commonly felt emotions
LIST OF COMMONLY FELT EMOTIONS
When you finish identifying the emotion you want to explore write it down at the top of the
Describe Your Emotion form on the next page or use a blank piece of paper
Then using your imagination draw a picture of what your emotion might look like
For example if you are feeling happy maybe
The picture doesn’t have to make sense to anyone else but you
Just give it a try
Next try to think of a sound that would further describe the emotion
Describe the sound as best you can and write it
Then describe an action that “fits” your emotion
For example if you are feeling bored maybe
Or if you are feeling shy maybe the action would be to run
Do your best to describe the action and write it near your drawing
The next step of this exercise is to describe the intensity of the emotion on which you’re
This will require some thought
Do your best to describe the strength of this emotion
Feel free to be creative and use metaphors if you need to
For example if you are feeling very
After describing the intensity of the emotion briefly describe the overall quality of what the
Again feel free to be as creative as you need to be in your description
Finally add any thoughts that arise due to your emotion
But be clear that what you describe
For example don’t choose any of the words in the list above
Those are emotions not thoughts
Your thoughts should be able to finish
Here are some examples of thoughts
If you are feeling confident a related thought might be that you
Or if you are feeling fragile a related thought could be that
Draw a picture of your emotion
Describe the intensity of the emotion
Describe the quality of the emotion
Describe thoughts related to the emotion
This next exercise will teach you the third “what” skill which is learning to identify what you
Now that you’ve practiced being
This exercise is similar to the InnerOuter Experience exercise because it will also help you shift your attention back and forth in a mindful focused way
However this Focus Shifting exercise will address the shift between your emotions and your senses
At some point in our lives we all get caught in our emotions
This “emotional trap” is a common
Before starting this exercise you’ll also need to identify how you are currently feeling
Do your best to be as accurate as possible about how you feel
Even if you think that you’re not feeling anything you probably
A person is never completely without emotion
Maybe you’re just feeling bored or content
Read the instructions before beginning this exercise to familiarize yourself with the experience
Then you can either keep these instructions near you if you need to refer to them while
If you need to set a timer for five to ten minutes for this exercise
To begin find a comfortable place to sit in a room where you won’t be disturbed for ten minutes
Turn off any distracting sounds
Take a few slow long breaths and relax
Now close your eyes and focus your attention on how you are feeling
Use your imagination to envision what your emotion might look like if it had a shape
Just allow your imagination to give your emotion a
Take a minute to do this and keep breathing slow breaths
Now open your eyes and put your focus on an object in the room where you’re sitting
Notice its shape and color
Imagine what that object might feel like if you could
Imagine what the object must weigh
Describe the object silently to yourself being as descriptive
Take a minute to do this
If your focus begins to drift simply return your
When you’ve finished describing the object close your eyes and return your focus to your emotion
Think of a sound that might be related to your emotion
The sound can be anything that you think
It can be a noise a song or whatever
Again it can be anything that further enhances
Take a minute to do this and keep breathing slow deep breaths
Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions
Now keeping your eyes closed redirect your attention to your sense of hearing
Notice sounds you hear coming from outside your room and note to yourself what
Now become aware of any sounds you hear coming from inside the room and note to yourself
Try to notice even small sounds such as the ticking of a clock the sound of the wind or
If you become distracted by any thoughts return your focus to your sense of
Take a minute to do this and keep breathing
When you have finished listening to the sounds that you can notice return your focus to your
Keeping your eyes closed silently describe the intensity and quality of your emotion to yourself
Again feel free to be creative and use comparisons if you need to
Take a minute to do this and keep
Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions
Once again redirect your attention
This time put your focus on your sense of smell
If you don’t notice any smells just become aware of
Try your best to maintain
If you become distracted by any thoughts return your focus to your
Take a minute to do this and keep breathing
When you have finished using your sense of smell once again return your focus to your emotions
Notice any thoughts you might be having that are related to your emotion
Be as specific about the thought
Take a minute to do this and keep
Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions
Now finally redirect your attention to your sense of touch
Reach out with one of your hands to
Or if there is no object within reach touch the chair you’re sitting in
Notice what the object feels like
Notice if it’s smooth or rough
Notice if it’s pliable or
Notice if it’s soft or solid
Notice what the sensations feel like on the skin of your fingertips
When you’ve finished take three to five slow long breaths and return your focus to the room
This Mindful Breathing exercise will help you learn the fourth “what” skill which is learning to
Very often when you’re distracted by your thoughts
This type of breathing also causes you to take fuller
In order to breathe mindfully you need to focus on three parts of the experience
This will help you focus your attention and it will also help you calm your
Second you need to focus on the physical experience
This is accomplished by observing the rising and falling of your chest and stomach
And third you need to be aware of any distracting thoughts that arise
Then you need to let the thoughts go without getting stuck on them as in
Letting go of the distracting thoughts will allow you to
Read the instructions before beginning the exercise to familiarize yourself with the experience
If you feel more comfortable listening to the instructions use an audiorecording device to
When you first start this technique set a timer or an alarm clock for three to five minutes
Then as you get more accustomed to using this
But don’t expect to be able to sit still that long when you first start
Later when you become more accustomed
When using mindful breathing many people feel as if they become “one” with their breathing meaning that they feel a deep connection to the experience
If that happens for you that’s
If not that’s okay too
Also some people feel lightheaded when they
This may be caused by breathing too fast too deeply or
If you begin to feel lightheaded stop if you need to or return your
This is such a simple and powerful skill that ideally you should practice it every day
To begin find a comfortable place to sit in a room where you won’t be disturbed for as long as
Turn off any distracting sounds
If you feel comfortable closing your eyes do so to
Place one hand on your stomach
Feel your stomach rise and
Imagine your belly filling up with air like a balloon as you breathe in and then feel
Feel the breath moving in across your nostrils and then feel your breath
As you breathe notice the sensations in your body
Feel your lungs fill up
Notice the weight of your body resting on whatever you’re sitting on
Now as you continue to breathe begin counting your breaths each time you exhale
Count each exhalation until you reach “4” and then begin counting
To begin breathe in slowly through your nose and then exhale slowly through your mouth
Count “1” Again breathe in slowly through your nose and slowly out through your mouth
Repeat breathing in slowly through your nose and then slowly exhale
Count “3” Last time—breathe in
Count “4” Now begin counting at “1” again
This time though as you continue to count occasionally shift your focus to how you’re breathing
Notice the rising and falling of your chest and stomach as you inhale and exhale
If you want to place one hand on your
Continue counting as you take slow long breaths
Now lastly begin to notice any thoughts or other distractions that remove your focus from your
These distractions might be memories sounds physical sensations or emotions
Or return your focus to the physical sensation of breathing
Try not to criticize yourself for
Just keep taking slow long breaths into your belly in and out
Feel it rising with each inhalation and falling with each exhalation
Keep breathing until your alarm goes off
Continue counting your breaths noticing the physical
Exercise Mindful Awareness of Emotions
This is the second exercise that will help you learn to separate your thoughts emotions and physical sensations
Mindful awareness of your emotions starts with focusing on your breathing—just
Then after four or five slow long breaths shift your attention to how you feel emotionally in the present moment
Start by simply noticing if you feel good or bad
Then see if you can observe your emotion more closely
What word best describes the feeling
Keep watching the feeling and while you do continue
Notice the nuances of the feeling or perhaps the threads of
For example sometimes sadness has veins of anxiety or even anger
Sometimes shame is intertwined with loss or resentment
Emotions invariably come as a wave
They escalate then they reach a crest and finally they
You can observe this describing to yourself each point in the wave as the feeling grows
If you have difficulty finding an emotion that you’re feeling in the present moment you can
Think back to a situation during the last several weeks when you had a strong emotion
Keep recalling details of the scene until
Keep describing to yourself the changes in quality intensity or type of emotion you are
Ideally you should observe the feeling until it has significantly changed—in quality or
Just do your best to bring your focus back to your emotion whenever
Just stay with it until you’ve watched long enough to observe your emotion
As you learn to mindfully observe a feeling two important realizations can emerge
If you keep watching your emotions they
The second awareness is that the mere act of describing your feelings can give you a degree of control over them
Describing your emotions often has the effect of
Read the instructions before beginning the exercise to familiarize yourself with the experience
If you feel more comfortable listening to the instructions use an audiorecording device to
If you record the directions pause between each paragraph so you can leave time to
Take a long slow breath and notice the feeling of the air moving in through your nose going down
Take another breath and watch what happens in your body
Keep noticing the sensations in your body as you
Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions
Now turn your attention to what you feel emotionally
Look inside and find the emotion you are
Or find an emotion that you felt recently
Notice whether the emotion is a good
Notice whether it is pleasant or unpleasant
Just keep your attention on the feeling until
Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions
Now look for words to describe the emotion
For example is it elation contentment or excitement
Or is it sadness anxiety shame or loss
Whatever it is keep watching and describing the emotion in
Notice any change in the feeling and describe what’s different
If any distractions or thoughts
Notice if your feeling is intensifying or diminishing and describe what that’s like
Keep observing your emotion and letting go of distractions
Keep looking for words to describe the
If other emotions begin to weave in continue to
If your emotion changes into an altogether new emotion just keep observing it and finding
Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions
Thoughts physical sensations and other distractions will try to grab your attention
You’ve now learned some basic mindfulness skills
Hopefully you have a better understanding
In the next chapter you will build on these skills and learn more advanced
In the previous chapter you learned what mindfulness is and you also learned the basic “what”
This means that you learned to become more mindful of what
Focusing more fully on the present moment
Recognizing and focusing on your thoughts emotions and physical sensations
Focusing on your momenttomoment stream of awareness
Separating your thoughts from your emotions and physical sensations
WHAT YOU’LL LEARN IN THIS CHAPTER
Now in this chapter you’ll be introduced to the more advanced “how” skills of mindfulness
These skills will help you learn how to be both mindful and nonjudgmental in
In this chapter you will learn five “how” skills
How to use wise mind
How to use radical acceptance to acknowledge your daily experiences without judging
How to do what’s effective
How to create a mindfulness regimen for yourself in order to live your life in a more
How to overcome the hindrances of your mindfulness practice
Each of these exercises builds on the one before it
As stated in the last chapter wise mind is the ability to make healthy decisions about your life
This sounds easy to do but let’s consider
For example Leo was a successful salesman with a new company
He had a happy family
However Leo frequently became upset when he couldn’t
Despite the positive feedback he received from his supervisors
Leo couldn’t shake the feelings of failure that came from deals he couldn’t close
As a result a few
She eventually stopped trying to meet new people because she anticipated that
As a result she felt unworthy of anyone’s love and
Emotion mind occurs when you make judgments or decisions
But keep in mind that emotions themselves are not bad or problematic
We all need emotions to live healthy lives
The problems associated with emotion mind develop when your emotions control
This trap is especially dangerous for people with overwhelming emotions because emotion
Obviously rational thinking helps us solve problems and make decisions every day
But again as with emotions
We all know the story of the very intelligent
So here too a balance is needed in order to live a fulfilling healthy life
Again let’s consider the examples of Leo and
Both of them were being controlled by their emotion minds
He should have reminded himself of the facts of the situation he was already a successful salesman and he only became upset when he couldn’t close a deal
She received great feedback from both
So was it reasonable to stop meeting new people after a
This is why using wise mind is so important
You can develop wise mind by using the mindfulness skills you have already been practicing in chapter 3
Remember that part of what these exercises did was to help you recognize and
So you’ve already been using both your emotion mind
And by practicing those mindfulness skills even more it will become easier
Often both intuition and wise mind are described as “feelings” that come from “the gut” or the
The exercise that follows will help you get more in touch with your gut feelings
This exercise will help you locate the center of wise mind in your
This is the spot from which many people report making sensible wisemind decisions about
Interestingly this phenomenon of gut feelings might be supported by scientific evidence
Researchers have discovered that a vast web of nerves covers the area of the stomach
When you begin using this technique set a kitchen timer or an alarm clock for three to five
Then as you get more accustomed to
To begin find a comfortable place to sit in a room where you won’t be disturbed for as long as
Turn off any distracting sounds
If you feel comfortable closing your eyes do so to
Now locate the bottom of your sternum on your rib cage
You can do this by touching the bone
Take a few slow long breaths and relax
Now slowly breathe in through your nose and then slowly
Feel your abdomen rise and fall as you breathe
Feel your lungs fill up with air
Notice the weight of your body as it
With each breath notice how your body feels and allow your
Now as you continue to breathe let your attention focus on the spot underneath your hand
Continue to take slow long breaths
Continue to breathe and focus on the center of wise mind
Feel your hand resting on
As you focus your attention on your center of wise mind notice what appears
Then ask your center of wise mind what you should do about these problems or decisions
Don’t judge whatever answers you receive
Just note them to yourself and keep breathing
Continue to focus your attention on your center of wise mind
If no thoughts or answers come to your
Now continue to notice your breath rising and falling
Keep breathing and returning your focus to
Then when you’ve finished slowly open your eyes and
HOW TO MAKE WISEMIND DECISIONS
Now that you’ve had practice locating your wisemind center you can “check in” with that area
This can help you determine if a decision is a good one
To do this simply think about the action you are about to take and focus your attention on your
Then consider what your wise mind tells you
Does your decision feel like a
If so then maybe you should do it
If it doesn’t feel like a good decision then maybe
Checking in with your center of wise mind is
However some words of caution are needed here
When you first use wise mind to make decisions about your life it will probably be difficult to
The difference can be determined in three ways
When you made your decision were you being mindful of both your emotions and the facts
In other words did you make the decision based on both emotion mind
If you haven’t considered the facts of the situation and are being
Sometimes we need to let our
Did the decision “feel” right to you
Before you make a decision check in with your center
If you check in with your center of wise mind and
However maybe you feel nervous because you’re excited about doing something
Sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference and that’s
You can sometimes tell if you’ve used wise mind by examining the results of your decision
When you start using wise mind keep track of your decisions and
Another very important part of wise mind and mindfulness in general is a skill called radical
Distress Tolerance Skills but the following description will help you understand how it relates to
Radical acceptance means tolerating something without judging it or trying to
Remember the definition of mindfulness that we gave you in the last chapter
In many ways judgment is the royal road to suffering because when you judge
So in order to be truly mindful
Radical acceptance might sound like a difficult skill to master but it’s definitely worth the
Thomas struggled with a problem that’s very common for people
He divided everyone and everything into two categories they were
There was no inbetween for him
When people treated him nicely
This quick fluctuation between good
Over the years the accumulation of fluctuations and judgments made Thomas very sensitive to
He always expected that other people would make mistakes insult
One time his sister said that she couldn’t help him take his car
He criticized her for being ungrateful and selfish
However the truth was that she had to take her own daughter to the doctor but Thomas never
He was too wrapped up in his own judgmental thinking to really listen to
In truth Thomas had created a pattern in his life where all of his judgments and
When Thomas was finally introduced to the skill of radical acceptance he was critical of it
At first it was very difficult for him to not make judgments about himself and other
Slowly his thinking began to change
Thomas spent less time obsessing over
He also no longer thought of people as either just good or bad
He also became more mindful
As you can see from this example one of the hardest parts of using radical acceptance is
This takes practice and the skills
But recognizing when you’re being judgmental also takes time
When you’re first learning to be nonjudgmental there will be times when
Then you’ll recognize what you’re doing and you’ll be further critical of
That’s part of the learning process
On the fourth day the man remembers to walk around the
And on the fifth day he chooses to
Below are several exercises to help you develop a nonjudgmental attitude and to use the skill
But before you start let’s clarify radical acceptance a little more because it
To use radical acceptance does not mean that
Radical acceptance is a skill that is
However there’s no doubt that it will be tough to start using radical acceptance because it
Radical acceptance is one of the most important tools to learn in dialectical behavior therapy and
The first step to changing a problem is to recognize when that problem occurs
So to begin changing your judgmental thinking the first step is to recognize when you’re being judgmental and critical
On page 87 is a Negative Judgments Record
For the next week do your best to keep track
This includes those you make about
Make photocopies of the Negative Judgments Record if you need to and
If you decide that you’re only going to write down your negative judgments once a day such as before you go to sleep the process of learning radical acceptance will
At the end of the day you might forget many of the negative judgments that you’ve
In order to remind yourself to write down your negative judgments it might help to give

RADICAL ACCEPTANCE AND BEGINNER’S MIND
Remember radical acceptance means that you observe situations in your life without
In the previous exercise you focused on recognizing your
Remember the example of Thomas we recently gave you
He divided everyone into two
He liked people when they were good but when they did
As a result when you put someone into a category of being 100 percent good
But this doesn’t mean that you should never trust anyone
What radical acceptance says is
In some forms of meditation this is called beginner’s mind Suzuki 2001
This means that you should enter every situation and every relationship as if you were seeing it
This reoccurring newness prevents you from bringing any old judgments
good or bad into the present moment which allows you to stay more mindful
As a result it’s easy to
In the following exercise you’ll practice using radical acceptance and beginner’s mind
This exercise is similar to the last one but now you will need to be aware of both the positive and negative
Again if you need to use visual reminders to help you remember to
Do this exercise for at least one week or until you recognize that you’re starting to catch
The more quickly you record them after they occur the sooner radical
Use the example of the Beginner’s Mind Record
The blank Beginner’s Mind Record for your use is on the page
Hopefully after the last exercise it’s easy to see how putting labels on people thoughts and
So far in this chapter you’ve already recognized many of the problems associated with making
Judgments can trigger overwhelming emotions
Judgments can often lead to disappointment and suffering
Judgments prevent you from being truly mindful in the present moment
Obviously one of the problems with judgments and criticisms is that they occupy your
In many cases it can become very easy to start obsessing on a single judgment
Or maybe it was something good about yourself or
We’ve all had this experience
Probably you’re not being very mindful
And when those obsessive thoughts are judgments about yourself or someone else how easy is it for your emotions to get
Probably it’s very easy especially if you struggle with overwhelming emotions
I called myself “incompetent” since I’m not going to
After talking with my mother on the phone I
I was thinking that the bartender looked really nice
At first I told my boyfriend that he was sweet for
I found the “perfect” pair of jeans that are going to
I was thinking about how ugly one of the guys in the
I got upset and called myself an idiot when I realized
I got mad at my boyfriend for not helping me get all
I was thinking about what a perfect day tomorrow is
This exercise is very similar
Again the object is to
If you used a technique in the last chapter that worked use it again here
Imagine sitting in a field watching your judgments float away on clouds
Picture yourself sitting beside a stream watching your judgments float past on leaves
Picture yourself standing in a room with two doors then watch your judgments
If one of these ideas works for you that’s great
If not feel free to create your own
Before you begin this exercise review the records you filled out for the Negative Judgments
You can even keep these records near you so you can
Read the instructions before beginning the exercise to familiarize yourself with the experience
If you feel more comfortable listening to the instructions use an audiorecording device
To begin find a comfortable place to sit in a room where you won’t be disturbed for as long as
Turn off any distracting sounds
Take a few slow long breaths relax and close
After you do start to become aware of the judgments that you’re having
Start to observe the judgments
Don’t try to stop your thoughts and do your best not to criticize
Just watch the judgments arise and then using whatever technique
But then close your eyes and watch
Whatever the judgment is big or small important or unimportant watch the judgment arise in your
Use pictures to represent the thoughts or words whatever works best
Do your best to watch the judgments arise and disappear without getting hooked into them and
If more than one judgment comes up at the same time see them both arise
If the judgments come very quickly do your best to watch them all disappear without
Continue to breathe and watch the judgments come and go until your
When you’ve finished take a few more slow long breaths and then slowly open your eyes and
NONJUDGMENT AND YOUR DAILY EXPERIENCES
The purpose of the previous exercise is to help you let go of your judgments and the more you
Then after you’ve been practicing it regularly for at least a few
Maybe you’ll need to close your eyes for a few seconds if
Or maybe you’ll be in
That is when you will truly be using radical acceptance
Exercise Judgments vs the Present Moment
Now that you’ve practiced being mindful of your thoughts feelings and senses in the previous
In this exercise you will learn to shift your attention back and forth
When you spend a lot of time obsessing over your thoughts and judgments it’s easy to get
But again these fantasies often lead to
As you continue to practice your mindfulness skills in your life it
One of the easiest ways to do this is to become mindful of your
Grounding yourself in your physical sensations can
Read the following instructions before beginning the exercise to familiarize yourself with
Then you can either keep these instructions near you if you need to refer to
To begin find a comfortable place to sit in a room where you won’t be disturbed for ten minutes
Turn off any distracting sounds
Take a few slow long breaths close your eyes and relax
Now keeping your eyes closed focus your attention on the weight of your body as it rests on the seat
Notice the weight of your feet and legs resting on the ground
Notice the weight of your head resting on top of your neck
Now notice any tension you might be feeling anywhere in your body and imagine the tension
Again take your time to scan your body for any tension and keep
Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions
When you are finished scanning your body move your focus to your thoughts and judgments
Allow the thoughts and judgments to
Take a minute to do this and keep breathing slow long breaths
Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions
Now redirect your attention to your sense of hearing
Notice any sounds that you can hear coming
Now become aware of any sounds you hear
Try to notice even small sounds such
Take a minute to do this and keep breathing
Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions
When you are finished noticing any sounds once again redirect your focus to your thoughts and
Notice any thoughts or judgments that arise in your mind and when they do allow them to
Allow the thoughts and judgments to leave you without getting stuck on them
Take a minute to do this and keep breathing slow
Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions
This time put your focus on your sense of smell
If you don’t notice any smells just become aware
Try your best to maintain
If you become distracted by any thoughts return your focus to your
Take a minute to do this and keep breathing slow deep breaths
When you are finished noticing any smells once again redirect your focus to your thoughts and
Notice any thoughts or judgments that arise in your mind and when they do allow them to
Allow the thoughts and judgments to leave you without getting stuck on them
Take a minute to do this and keep breathing slow
Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions
Now redirect your attention to your sense of touch
Notice the sensation of whatever your hands
Or keeping your eyes closed reach out with one of your hands to touch an object that
Or if there is no object within reach touch the chair you’re sitting in or touch your leg
Notice what the object feels like
Notice if it’s smooth or rough
Notice if it’s pliable or rigid
Notice what the sensations feel like on the skin of your fingertips
Take a minute to do this and keep
Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions
When you are finished noticing any touch sensations once again redirect your focus to your thoughts
Notice any thoughts or judgments that arise in your mind and when they do allow them
Take a minute to do this and keep breathing slow
Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions
Now slowly open your eyes
Keep breathing slow deep breaths
Take a few minutes to focus your
Notice the objects that are in the room
Notice the different colors that are in the room
Notice where you are in the room
Move your head to look around
Take in all the visual information that you can
Take a minute to do this and keep
Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions
When you have finished noticing any visual sensations once again redirect your focus to your
But this time keep your eyes open
Pick a few objects in the room to focus on
But in your mind continue to notice any thoughts and judgments that arise and when they do allow
Allow the thoughts and judgments to leave you without getting stuck on them
But open your eyes once the thoughts have floated
Continue to monitor your thoughts and judgments
Take a minute to do this and keep breathing
Pause here for one minute if you are recording the instructions
When you’ve finished if you still have time left continue to switch your focus between your thoughts
Then when your timer goes off take three to five slow long
As you continue to practice mindfulness skills by yourself it’s also very important that you begin
Mindful communication is often the
If you’re constantly making judgmental statements to someone the
In the chapters on interpersonal effectiveness
But for now let’s look
“You’re such a jerk I could scream”
“Sometimes you make me so upset I just want to end it all”
“I know that you did that to me on purpose just to hurt me”
What do all of these statements have in common
It’s true that they all express some kind
But more importantly they’re all judgments of the
Each of the statements blames the other person for the way the speaker feels
Maybe you would say something just as angry back to the person which would lead to a big fight
The result would be that nothing gets resolved
Or maybe you would just shut down emotionally
Again nothing would get resolved
So what can you do instead
One of the solutions is to turn “you” statements into mindful “I” statements
Mindful “I” statements are based on your own mindful awareness of how you feel
Mindful “I” statements are a more accurate description of how you feel
Mindful “I” statements evoke greater empathy and understanding from the other
Let’s look at the four previous examples and turn them from “you” statements into mindful
Instead of saying “You make me mad” say “Right now I feel very mad” Doesn’t that sound
If someone said the alternative statement to you “I feel very mad”
Wouldn’t you feel less angry
Look at the second sentence
The other person no longer feels blamed and will be more willing
And finally look at the last sentence
Again mindful “I” statements are more accurate about how you feel they are less judgmental
Now let’s look at some more judgmental “you” statements and have you practice turning them into
Write your alternative mindful “I” statement in the space to the right of
“You make me feel horrible”
“I know you’re doing this on purpose to make me go crazy”
“Why do you keep making me feel so angry”
“Stop fooling around you’re getting on my nerves”
“If you don’t listen to what I’m telling you I’m not going to talk to you anymore”
“You’re being a jerk stop it”
“Sometimes I feel like you’re being too inflexible”
Did it get harder to think of mindful “I” statements as the exercise progressed
Let’s look at some possible
The first sentence was easy
The message is that the speaker feels horrible
In the second sentence the speaker feels crazy anxious or upset
“I” statement could be “I feel crazyanxiousupset when you do that”
In the third sentence the speaker feels angry
So an alternative mindful “I” statement could
So an alternative mindful “I”
In the fifth sentence the speaker feels anxious tired or angry
So an alternative mindful “I”
In the sixth sentence the speaker feels insulted unheard and ignored
But he or she also
In the seventh sentence the speaker might feel many things
Usually when you ask someone
So maybe the speaker feels hurt and an
The eighth sentence is trickier
The speaker calls the other person some insulting expletive
This also usually indicates that the speaker’s feelings have been hurt
So an alternative mindful “I”
The ninth sentence is phrased as a question but it’s really a statement about how the speaker
Again the implication is that the speaker feels hurt insulted belittled or something similar
And lastly the tenth sentence is the trickiest because the speaker uses the word “feel” Maybe
However now you know better so don’t fall into
In this case something about the other person’s inflexible actions make the speaker
Maybe the other person never considers other points of view before
Mindful “I” statements are clearly a more effective way of communicating how you feel and
Using successful communication skills such as mindful “I” statements is a part of what dialectical
This means that you do what’s
For example you’re probably not comfortable making statements
But sometimes in order to get what you want you have to modify what you feel like
Here are some other examples of
You’re in the grocery store shopping for your weekly supply of food but unfortunately so are many other people
After shopping for an hour and waiting in line
You’re so tired and annoyed that you think
But if you did walk out
So you stay in line and just get it over with
You’re driving down the freeway and the car in front of you is driving below the
You feel so angry that you think about smashing
But if you did you and the other driver
You and your romantic partner get into a big argument
Both of you are yelling
You feel so hurt and upset that you think about walking out the door and ending
But in the back of your mind you also recognize that this is the
So instead of leaving you take a deep breath and use mindful “I” statements to
Your boss gives you a new task even though you’re already burdened with more
You feel insulted angry and taken advantage of
You’re so mad that you think about screaming at your boss telling him off quitting
But if you did then you’d be without a paycheck for a
So you decide to bite your tongue for now until you can speak to your
You ask your friend to take you shopping because she has a car and you don’t
You want to yell at
But if you did you might lose her friendship completely
So instead of yelling you call a different friend to ask for a ride
As you can see doing what’s effective sometimes means not doing what you feel like doing
This is why mindfulness is such
Doing what’s effective also depends on not making judgments
You already know that making
But making judgments about situations and your actions can also prevent you from doing what’s effective
“This is ridiculous” she thought to herself
Judith’s judgments about what was “right” and “wrong” prevented
Clearly it would have been more beneficial to her if she had
Doing what’s effective is doing what is necessary in a given situation in order to get a resolution to a problem
Doing what’s effective isn’t “selling out” “giving up” or “caving in”
Doing what’s effective is a skill just like acting
Sometimes in order to get what you want
Sometimes you have to act as if you are competent skilled
In the example above Judith’s goal was to
But she allowed her judgments and feelings to prevent
Remember in order to do what’s effective you have to do the following
Be mindful of your thoughts and feelings
Avoid judging the situation or your actions
Choose actions that are appropriate and necessary to reach your goal
Do the best you can
BEING MINDFUL IN YOUR DAILY LIFE
Now that you’ve almost completed these two chapters on mindfulness skills you probably recognize
But to be realistic no one is mindful all the time
There will certainly be moments in your life when you’ll forget to be mindful
In his book Living the Mindful Life A Handbook for Living in the Present Moment psychologist
The effort is very small
We forget all the time
Throughout his book Dr Tart uses a bell that rings at random times to
But if you don’t want to
Or maybe you used sticky notes
If those tools helped you continue to use them to remind yourself to stay mindful
However the best way to continue to stay mindful in your daily life is to practice being
The more you practice the more you will remember to stay mindful
It’s very important that you continue to use these skills and to practice other
Mindfulness skills are so important to the overall effectiveness
Your daily mindfulness regimen will consist of three skills that you’ve already learned
Mindful breathing is a skill you learned in chapter 3 Basic Mindfulness Skills
You must count your breaths
This will help you focus your attention and it will also
You need to focus on the physical experience of breathing
You need to be aware of any distracting thoughts that arise while you are breathing
Then you need to let the thoughts float past without getting stuck on them as you did
Letting go of the distracting thoughts will allow you
Practice breathing mindfully for three to five minutes a day at a minimum
Remember the more frequently you practice
Refer to the Mindful Breathing exercise in chapter 3 if you need to review
The wisemind meditation is a skill you learned earlier in this chapter
It will help you focus
It incorporates using both your emotion mind and your reasonable mind meaning that
what you know to be “true” for you
Again practice the wisemind meditation for at least three
Doing tasks mindfully means doing all the things you normally do in your life like talking walking
In effect this is the
To do tasks mindfully you need to do the following
Focus and shift your attention between your thoughts feelings physical sensations
Let go of distracting thoughts and judgments by allowing them to float past without
Use radical acceptance to remain nonjudgmental
Use wise mind to make healthy decisions about your life
Do what’s effective in order to accomplish your goals
Some people find it helpful to use the following memory device to remind themselves to do
“Mindfulness is like a FLAME”
Focus and shift your attention to be mindful of the present moment
Let go of distracting thoughts and judgments
Use radical Acceptance to remain nonjudgmental
Use wise Mind to make healthy decisions
Do what’s Effective to accomplish your goals
Let’s look at some examples of doing tasks mindfully using all the skills you’ve learned in
After reading these two chapters Loretta began approaching many of her tasks mindfully
At night she would even brush her teeth mindfully
First she focused her attention on how the
Then as she began to brush she became aware of the
When distracting thoughts arose such as things she did earlier in the day she imagined
If judgments arose about people she knew she did
Then she continued to shift her focus every
Loretta did a good job being as aware as
At other times throughout the day she had
When she washed the dishes she paid attention to how
While she was cooking she was very aware of
She did her best to let those judgments go and to be as fully present in the moment of
Similarly Scott did his best to be mindful throughout the day
As he walked he focused his
Sometimes he was even aware of how
Then he would shift his focus to what he was seeing
When distracting thoughts arose he imagined the
Similarly if positive judgments arose about people or places he liked he did his best to let those go too
He’s the guy that loaned me twenty dollars
He’s the greatest guy in the world
And if the judgments came back he would let them go again
But clearly the greatest challenge to using mindfulness skills is when you are interacting with
Talking or arguing with someone and being mindful at the same time is often difficult
Claire had been practicing her mindfulness skills for a few weeks when she went shopping for
Sometimes Claire worried that Laura really didn’t like her
However Claire didn’t like the fact that Laura pushed her into doing
On the way to the store Claire drove and she did her best to remain mindful of what she
She felt the steering wheel in her hands
She felt the weight of her body resting in the
She felt her breath rising and falling as she breathed
She was also very aware of what she was
But she was also very aware of Laura talking to her as she drove
Naturally judgments about Laura came up while Claire was driving and she did her best to just
However some judgments were easier to let go of than others
When they got to the shopping mall Claire also had opportunities to use radical acceptance
There were certain stores she liked and certain stores she didn’t like
At first she was positive that
But quickly Claire recognized the positive judgments she was making and she let them go
That was lucky too because none of the stores she liked had the dress she was looking for
But because of radical acceptance her neutrality and her nonjudgmental attitude allowed her to cope with the situation in a healthier way
Later the two women found themselves in a higherend store looking at dresses that were
However both she and Laura found a dress that
Immediately Laura began pressuring Claire to buy it
Claire looked at herself in the mirror and fell in love with the dress regardless
Claire was about to buy the dress when she remembered to use wise mind to help
Her emotion mind loved the dress but her reasonable mind reminded her
Instantly she knew it was a very bad idea to
Claire was proud of herself for making the right decision but the drama didn’t end there
Laura began making fun of Claire for being “too cheap” to buy the dress
She did her best to let them go but as Laura continued
Claire wanted to scream at Laura but she knew that would end up in a big fight
She knew that she just had to get home as quickly
Claire drove home silently listening to Laura’s criticisms
She was relieved when she finally
Later when Claire was feeling less angry she even found the courage
Claire did a great job using mindful “I” statements such
BE MINDFUL OF YOUR MINDFULNESS ACTIVITIES
Obviously it will take lots of practice to become as mindful as Claire was in that situation
In the beginning of chapter 3 Basic Mindfulness Skills you learned that there were three
They will help you focus on one thing at a time in the present moment and by doing
They will help you learn to identify and separate judgmental thoughts from your
They will help you develop wise mind
Unfortunately there is no shortcut to becoming instantaneously and permanently mindful
But as Dr Charles Tart said learning how to be mindful isn’t a strenuous activity you simply
So however you need to remember to be mindful we hope it works for
One way is to use the Weekly Mindfulness Activities Record on page 112
Make photocopies of this page for each week
This will help you keep track of your improvement doing
Under the headings of “Doing Tasks Mindfully” record what it was that you did
Then under the headings labeled “Other Mindful Exercise” record any further mindfulness
So continue to use them even as you move on to using the other skills in this workbook
It is common to encounter inner resistance and difficulties as you practice mindfulness and develop
What many people do not know is that there are some hindrances to mindfulness that are
This final section of the chapter will help you identify five common hindrances to mindfulness meditation and suggest ways you can work skillfully with each one
Desire aversion sleepiness restlessness and doubt are the five hindrances long recognized as
These energies appear as obstacles when they take you out of the present moment or cause
However they do not have to be obstacles
Desire refers to the wish for things to be different—right now
This can be a wish
Aversion means having anger for or ill will toward what is here
Often the very activity of judgment or judgmental thinking is an ­expression
Sleepiness means just that—feeling sleepy heavy and dull
It is important to note
Learning to distinguish between these two is
Restlessness is the opposite of sleepy
It can be very uncomfortable
I don’t know how to do it
Working Wisely with the Hindrances
The first and most potent way to handle any of the hindrances is to make the experience of
Acknowledge what is happening without fighting
Gently place attention on desire aversion sleepiness restlessness or doubt and look deeply
Patiently return your soft and curious attention time and again as often as necessary to the hindrance energy naming it and learning what
The lessons can come in many ways including thoughts memories feelings
In addition you may find benefits in the following specific suggestions for each hindrance
For desire recall that no matter how many times you get what you desire you always
Let this wisdom empower you to resist the temptation of desire and
Keep noticing and naming desire without acting on it
For aversion recognize anger and ill will as some of your strongest teachers
At times it also helps if you can work to balance them by
For sleepiness know it as a powerful condition that demands your full attention
Splash water on your face
Take a break and do
For restlessness besides making it the object of mindfulness it can be very helpful to
Take a more narrow or smaller focus for example
For doubt especially when your mind is racing everywhere it can help to concentrate
When you can treat them as teachers not obstacles they will cease to be

YOUR EMOTIONS WHAT ARE THEY
To put it simply emotions are signals within your body that tell you what’s happening
In many ways your emotions are like an instant news service that gives you
Your initial reactions to what is happening to you are called primary emotions
For example if you won a contest you might instantaneously feel surprised
When someone does something that offends you you might
But in addition to experiencing primary emotions it’s also possible to experience secondary emotions
These are emotional reactions to your primary emotions
Or to put it another way
His feeling of anger came
But a little later he felt guilty about getting so angry with her
However it’s also possible that you can experience numerous secondary emotions in response
Here’s a more complicated example
As the day drew closer she became depressed
Then the day after the presentation she started to feel guilty
You can see how a person’s emotions
Anxiety was Shauna’s primary emotion and depression
It’s possible that your primary emotional reaction to a situation can set off a limitless chain
For this reason it’s important that you try to identify what your original primary
This is where emotion regulation skills can be
Emotion regulation skills are an important part of dialectical behavior therapy because
These skills are especially useful because without them people often choose to deal with
These are all harmful coping strategies that are often used
For this reason it’s extremely important that you learn the
Emotion regulation skills are also important for dealing with another problem called ambivalence
Ambivalence occurs when you have more than one emotional reaction to the same event and
Then one day when she was twentyfive
Tina felt excited about the opportunity of forming
Tina’s emotions were split and they pulled her in two different directions about what to do
If you’ve been dealing with overwhelming emotions for a long time it’s easy to understand
But remember although it might be difficult to control your primary emotional reaction there’s still hope
And it could be that later on when you start using all the skills in this
Emotions are electrical and chemical signals in your body that alert you to what is happening
These signals often begin with your senses of sight touch hearing smell and taste
Your emotions are extremely important for many reasons especially your survival
Louise was walking down Main Street when suddenly a very large and angry dog began
In that instant an emotional signal was sent from
This type of response is called fight or flight and it determined
Wisely she chose to run away and she
Her emotions helped her survive and avoid any pain
Now let’s suppose that two weeks later she was once again walking through town when she
Very quickly she began to feel afraid
This is called a conditioned
Sensibly she chose to walk down a different street to avoid the dog
Here’s another example of how emotions work
Sheila was walking through town when she
When Courtney saw Sheila she smiled right away
The two women quickly reconnected and
The encounter made both women feel
In this example the smile was an act of communication for both women
If Courtney had frowned and looked the other
Every person no matter what their culture has the ability
These are just two very simple examples but you can see that emotions serve many purposes
Emotions are signals that help you to do the following
Cope with situations in your daily life
WHAT ARE EMOTION REGULATION SKILLS
As you’ve already learned emotion regulation skills will help you cope with your reactions to your
In dialectical behavior therapy there are nine emotion regulation skills that will help you
Overcoming the barriers to healthy emotions
Being mindful of your emotions without judgment
Doing the opposite of your emotional urges
This chapter will cover the first five emotion regulation skills and the next chapter will cover
As in the previous chapters the exercises in these two chapters will build on
Learning how to recognize your emotions and their effect on your life is the first step to controlling
Very often people spend their lives paying little attention
As a result there are a lot of important things happening inside them that they
The same holds true for people struggling with overwhelming emotions but it
Very often people struggling with this problem recognize the tidal wave
To control your overwhelming emotional reactions it’s first necessary to slow down the emotional process so that it can be examined
And then after it’s examined you can make healthier
This exercise will help you begin this process by examining an emotional situation that
It will require you to be as honest with yourself as possible
Ling struggled with overwhelming emotions that often got out of
One evening she came home from work and found her husband drunk on the sofa again
He refused to go to psychotherapy and he didn’t consider himself an alcoholic so he wouldn’t go
Ling immediately felt angry so she started screaming at
After a few minutes Ling started to feel hopeless and ashamed
She had tried everything to help her husband but nothing seemed to work
She thought about killing herself to end the pain she was feeling
But instead she took out a razor and started cutting herself on her leg just enough to make herself
Ling’s story is common for many people
Using this story let’s follow the sixstep process that
This is your opportunity to describe the situation that led to your emotions
In this example Ling comes home and once again finds her husband drunk
Why do you think that situation happened
This is an opportunity for you to identify the
This is a very important step because the meaning
For example if you think someone hurt you on purpose you will react very differently than if you think someone hurt you by accident
Here Ling believes that her
How did the situation make you feel both emotionally and physically
Learning how to identify your emotions will
Also try to identify how you were feeling physically
In this example Ling’s primary emotion
Physically she notices that all the muscles in her face and
What did you want to do as a result of how you felt
This question is very important
Often when a person is overwhelmed with emotions he
However the person doesn’t always do these things sometimes the urges are just
When you start to notice what you want to do and compare it
In this example Ling had
Thankfully she didn’t do either one which
What did you do and say
This is where you identify what you actually did as a result
In this example Ling locks herself in her bathroom and begins to
She also yells at her husband and calls him a “worthless drunk”
How did your emotions and actions affect you later
Here you can identify the longerterm
In Ling’s example she oversleeps for work the

No one has to see this worksheet
Then for at least the next two weeks pick a situation that happens to you each day and
Remember you need to practice
I came home and my husband was lying on the sofa drunk again
He still refuses to go to therapy or AA
I yelled at him and called

My husband is an alcoholic who hates me and regrets marrying
I also think he’s given up on his own life and just does things
Secondary emotions Hopelessness and shame
Physical sensations Face and arms became tense sick to my
I wanted to hit my husband and I had the urge to kill myself to
I locked myself in the bathroom and started cutting myself
Then I went to bed by myself because I was so angry
I yelled at my husband and called him a “worthless drunk”
I was so angry when I went to bed that I forgot to set my alarm
So I woke up late for work
When I got in my boss yelled at me
He said that if I’m late one more time he’ll have to fire

To help you recognize your emotions it’s often helpful to say how you’re feeling out loud
So the more you can talk about an emotion the less urge you might have to

OVERCOMING THE BARRIERS TO HEALTHY EMOTIONS
Now that you’ve started to recognize your emotions more fully hopefully you’re also noticing how
Please look carefully at the following
This diagram depicts how your emotions can influence your thoughts and behaviors and also how
For example Jim lost his favorite
But this thought just made him feel more depressed an emotion so he
Do you see how your
This can become a vicious cycle for your emotions if you get caught in selfdestructive behaviors or selfcritical thinking
But this cycle can also lead to more fulfilling emotional experiences if
For example maybe after Jim lost his
Or after feeling sad about losing his
There were many coping thoughts and behaviors Jim could have used to
Clearly your emotions and your behaviors are strongly linked and not surprisingly stronger emotions often lead to bigger behavioral reactions
As a result many people with overwhelming feelings
They cut or mutilate themselves
Obviously these types of behaviors are harmful to
Yet people who engage in these behaviors often do them repeatedly
The answer lies in your emotions
Let’s start with the basics many behaviors are repeated because they are rewarded
A student goes to school for the reward of a degree
People play sports for the reward of competing
A musician plays an instrument for the reward of
And a gardener plants flowers for the reward of seeing them blossom
And if you only got weeds every
In the same way your emotions can serve as rewards that reinforce your behavior
Stefan was very grateful which made Phil feel happy
So the next time Stefan asked for a favor Phil was happy to help
However emotions can reinforce selfdestructive behaviors as well
As a young girl Teresa had never been taught how to cope with her distressing
When she was in emotional or physical pain she suffered alone without anyone’s help
No one paid attention to how she felt
Then as an adult she realized that someone would give her and her pain attention if she
For example when Teresa felt upset
Then he would finally recognize how Teresa felt
Teresa may not have been
Her husband recognizes how she feels
However the way Teresa coped with her distressing feelings only made her feel better for a
In the long term her marriage suffered at the expense of her emotional validation
Teresa and her husband had frequent fights as a result of her behaviors and these
Two types of selfdestructive behaviors that people with overwhelming emotions often engage
Both of these behaviors offer shortterm
Many people who cut burn or scar themselves say that their actions make them feel better
To a certain degree they’re right
These painkillers can make a person feel physically and emotionally
Yet as temporary as these rewards are these physical and
But remember these behaviors can be
And while the pain relief is temporary the scars
If you engage in any cutting or selfmutilating behaviors identify what those behaviors are in
Then identify what the temporary rewards might be
The cutting and selfmutilating behaviors that I engage in are
The temporary rewards for my behaviors are
The longterm costs and dangers of my behaviors are
In the earlier example you saw why Teresa picked fights with her husband when she was
Her actions though damaging to her marriage made her feel better for a short
Her behavior was rewarded with emotional validation so it was repeated in the
But the frequent fights with her husband made her feel even worse in the long run
Similarly other forms of manipulation can have shortlived emotional rewards that lead to
When you force someone into doing what you want maybe you feel satisfied or in
These can all be strong emotional rewards especially considering that many people with
But again even these emotional
Whenever Brandy felt bored she liked to “mess with people” just to
Often she would lie to her friends and tell them phony rumors she claimed to
Then when her friends would get upset Brandy would pretend to comfort
This made her feel powerful until her friends discovered the truth and then stopped talking
Similarly Jason was very controlling of his girlfriend Patricia
When they would go out for
He also wouldn’t let her
Patricia really cared about Jason and
So despite his suicidal threats Patricia broke up with him
Remember no one likes to be manipulated
Eventually the person who is being manipulated
Then the relationship becomes confrontational and unrewarding and often ends very painfully
This is usually the worst possible result for

Different foods can affect the way you feel as can the amount of food you eat
But if you eat too much of them you might start to feel heavy and sluggish
This often makes people feel sad or unhappy about themselves and it can also lead to health problems like diabetes and heart disease
Other foods with high sugar content like candy and soda
But as the effect wears off these foods can leave you feeling
Just as eating too much of certain foods can make you feel ill eating too little food can also

Like food anything else you put in your body will affect how you feel
Naturally these feelings can lead to repeated use of these substances especially after the temporary feelings have worn
However the excessive use of alcohol street drugs or abused prescription drugs can lead to
For example alcohol is a depressant that makes you feel tired sluggish and sad
But with enough alcohol in anyone’s body he or she will start to feel sad

OBSERVING YOURSELF WITHOUT JUDGING YOURSELF
As you can see from the previous exercise selfdestructive behaviors can only offer you temporary
In the long term they are all more damaging to yourself and others
But at the same time also remember that you shouldn’t criticize or judge yourself if you
Remember that the principle on which
The most important dialectic is accepting yourself without judgment while simultaneously
Your behaviors probably exist as they do because you were never taught how to deal with
That’s what the skills in this
You’ve already learned how your thoughts influence how you feel
Remember Jim who lost his
He originally thought “I’m so absentminded I’m an idiot” which just made him feel
However we all have trigger thoughts that pop up from time to time
The goal of developing emotion regulation skills is to learn what to do with those thoughts when they do come up
Some of these thoughts are criticisms that we were told when we were children by our parents
Below are several trigger thoughts that often cause a person to feel emotionally distressed
Check  any of them that you use and then write any additional trigger thoughts in the space
If you have trouble remembering a trigger thought that you use think of the last time
These are your trigger thoughts
“I can’t do anything right”
“No one’s ever going to love me”
“There’s something wrong with me”
“No one cares about me”
“I’m going to be alone forever”
Obviously a trigger thought can be a powerful negative force in your life if it constantly
But remember in addition to trigger
Coping thoughts can be an equally powerful force if you know how to
In this section you’ll learn three cognitive skills to help you deal with trigger thoughts
Mindfulness Skills but it’s so important as an emotion regulation skill that it deserves to be
This is a skill that requires the use of your imagination

Now in your imagination picture yourself in the scenario that you chose to watch your thoughts
Don’t try to stop your thoughts and do your best not to
Just watch the thoughts arise and then using whatever technique
If any of your thoughts is a trigger thought just note to yourself that you’re having a trigger thought
Keep breathing slowly in and out as you watch your thoughts and emotions float away
When you notice distressing emotions arising in you because of your thoughts let them float past
Just continue to watch the thoughts and feelings arise and disappear
Use pictures or words to represent your thoughts and feelings whatever works best for you
Do your best to watch the thoughts and
If more than one thought or feeling comes up at the same time see them both arise and disappear
If the thoughts and feelings come very quickly do your best to watch them all disappear without getting
Continue to breathe and watch the thoughts and feelings come and go until your timer goes off
When you’ve finished take a few slow long breaths and then slowly open your eyes and return
Coping thoughts are designed to soothe your emotions when you’re in a distressing situation
They are statements that remind you of your strength your past successes and some commonly

Think about what a limited dreary life you might have
In order to begin balancing your thoughts—and therefore your emotions as well—it’s ­necessary
Evidence supporting your selfcriticisms versus evidence that you’re a good person
Evidence that only bad things happen to you versus evidence that good things
Evidence that no one cares about you versus evidence that people do care about
Evidence that you never do anything right versus evidence of your past successes
Evidence that the current situation is awful versus evidence that it’s not as bad as
In general evidence for the bad versus evidence for the good
Seeing the “big picture” is the opposite of filtering
This can be hard to do if you’ve spent your
But you can learn to see the big
Then with practice you’ll filter less
In order to see the big picture use the following guidelines
As a result what did you think and feel
What evidence supports how you think and feel
What evidence contradicts how you think and feel
What’s a more accurate and fair way to think and feel about this situation
Naturally when you start to feel overwhelmed by a situation first ask yourself what happened
This is the best place to start
Identify what it is that’s making you feel upset
Second identify your thoughts and feelings
Remember your thoughts greatly influence
But if your thoughts about a situation are being filtered and you’re not seeing the
Third ask yourself what evidence supports how you’re thinking and feeling about the situation
This is usually an easy question to answer
After all this is what you usually do
The fourth question however is usually new and challenging for people struggling with overwhelming emotions
Asking yourself to identify the evidence that contradicts how you think and
They’re both looking at the same landscape but the person
Similarly you need to examine more of the facts and evidence that affect your situation and
As you saw earlier in the examples people often filter out the positive

Now consider how that information contradicts
Remember since this question is new for you it often takes some time to think of an answer
So give yourself a few minutes to think about the possible facts before saying “There is no contradictory evidence” Be fair and kind to yourself
There’s always evidence for and against any topic
And even if the contradictory evidence is minor it still adds to your big picture
Even if her example was different and she was a B student or a hardworking student
Next keeping in mind the new evidence that contradicts the trigger thought ask yourself
Therefore don’t be critical of yourself
Try to be accepting of yourself and your emotions as

Obviously using the questions in this exercise isn’t going to magically change the way you feel
But asking yourself these questions will help you recognize the facts that you’ve been filtering out and it will also show you the possibilities of how you might react to a similar situation in the
Then with practice you’ll start reacting to those similar situations in a new healthier way
Seeing the big picture will also give you hope for your future

Before you picked up this workbook for the first time you were probably an expert on distressing emotions and you understood what a life filled with them could feel like
Maybe that’s what you did before but now you know that it’s very important for you to
This doesn’t mean that you’ll never experience another

In this chapter you will learn four advanced emotion regulation skills
Being mindful of your emotions without judgment
Doing the opposite of your emotional urges
In chapter 3 Basic Mindfulness Skills you learned how to recognize and describe your emotions
Now in this chapter emotion exposure will further help you practice two very important
First you will learn to observe the natural life cycle of your emotions watching them rise
Second you’ll learn that you can
You’ll get practice staying “in” the
Emotion exposure is a crucial process for learning not to fear your feelings
The more you practice this exposure work the more
In addition to being mindful of your emotions without judgment and emotion exposure you’ll
First you change your facial expression and body
If you’re angry you may begin to scowl and tighten your fists
On the other hand if you’re scared your eyes may open wide while you hunch your shoulders
The second behavioral change comes from action urges that accompany every emotion
“Doing the opposite of your emotional urges” is a strategy that blocks ineffective emotiondriven
The next step will be learning key behavior analysis and problemsolving skills to deal more
You’ll identify what prompts the emotion and learn how
The last thing we’ll do in this chapter is introduce you to an exercise regime called the Weekly
It will help you to keep practicing the key emotion regulation skills you’ve learned here

Learning to be mindful of your emotions without judging them decreases the chance that they will
Exercise Being Mindful of Your Emotions Without Judgment
This technique begins with the mindful awareness of your breath
Focus on the feeling of the air
After four or five slow deep breaths you can do one of two things 1
If you visualize a scene notice
Try to remember what was said and how you and others acted
Read the instructions before beginning the exercise to familiarize yourself with the experience
If you feel more comfortable listening to the instructions use an audiorecording device to
While breathing slowly and evenly bring your attention to where you are feeling the emotion in your
Is it a feeling in your chest or stomach in your shoulders or in your face or head
Notice any physical sensations connected with the emotion
Now be aware of the
Is it growing or diminishing
Is the emotion pleasant or painful
Do you have thoughts about the emotion
Just keep watching your emotion and keep observing
Now imagine that each judgment is one of the following
A leaf floating down a stream around a bend and out of sight
A computer popup ad that briefly flashes on the screen and disappears
One of a long string of boxcars passing in front of you at a railroad crossing
A cloud cutting across a windy sky
A message written on a billboard that you approach and pass at high speed
One of a procession of trucks or cars approaching and passing you on a desert
Choose the image that works best for you
The key is to notice the judgment place it on a billboard
Just keep observing your emotion
When a judgment about yourself or others begins to manifest
Now it’s time to remind yourself of the right to feel whatever you feel
Emotions come and go like
They rise up and then recede
Whatever you feel no matter how strong or painful is
Take a slow breath and accept the emotion as something that lives in you for
Visualize them and then let them pass
Let your emotions be what
You ride your emotions for a little while and then they
This is natural and normal
It’s what it means to be human
Looking back on this exercise you may have found it to be hard work
But you are doing something important—you
Remember the key steps to the practice of observing your emotions without judging them
Focus on emotion current or past
Notice physical sensations connected to emotion
Notice judgments about self others or the emotion itself and let them go
Watch the emotion emotions are like waves on the sea
Remind yourself that you have a right to your feelings
Continue to notice and let go of judgments
Finish with three minutes of mindful breathing
Facing your emotions instead of avoiding them is a major goal of dialectical behavior therapy
Emotion exposure helps you develop the capacity to accept feelings and be less afraid of them
Step 1 is to begin keeping an Emotion Log so you can become more aware of specific emotional events and how you cope with them
For the next week keep a record in your Emotion Log
Under “Event” write down what precipitated your
Triggering events could be internal—a thought memory or another feeling—or they could
Under “Emotion” write a word or phrase
Under “Coping or Blocking Response” write what you did to try to
Did you try to suppress or hide it
Did you act on it by picking a fight or
This record of your coping or blocking response will help you identify
Linda who had been struggling with anger and feelings of rejection kept the following
Emotion Log during the week before Christmas

Emotions that show up repeatedly or have blocking strategies that create more pain than they
Emotions with ineffective or destructive blocking strategies require exposure because you need practice facing and feeling them—without your
Those don’t work and often just get you in more trouble
Linda after reviewing her log realized that the things she did to cope with feelings of rejection attacking or criticizing people being cold and rejecting were only digging her into a deeper
She ended up with overwhelming feelings of guilt and selfhate and seemed even
Linda needed to learn how to be with her feelings and how to observe them without the
Emotion exposure would prove to be a tremendously important
As soon as you start feeling the emotion you’ve chosen to work on do the following procedure
You can either read the instructions to yourself or record and listen to them
Take three or four deep diaphragmatic breaths
Notice how the breath feels in your throat as it fills
While breathing slowly notice how you feel inside your
Notice your neck and shoulders and face
Now notice how you feel emotionally
Just keep your attention on the feeling till you have a sense
Describe that feeling to yourself
Notice the strength of the feeling
Notice if the emotion is growing or diminishing
If the emotion were a wave at what point
Pause here for a few seconds if you are recording the instructions
Now notice any changes in the feeling
Are there other emotions beginning to weave into the first
Describe to yourself any new emotions that have appeared
Just keep watching and looking for words
As you continue to watch you may notice a need to block the emotion to push it away
Remind yourself that this is a wave that passes like countless other emotional waves in your life
There are many times when you’ve felt good
Soon this wave will pass and you will
Watch the wave and let it slowly pass
If judgment—about yourself or another—arises notice it and let it go
As best you can try to accept this feeling
Stay aware of your emotions just a little longer
If they are changing let them change
Keep watching until the emotion either changes or diminishes
Finish the exercise with a few minutes of mindful breathing—counting your breaths and focusing
We encourage you to do emotion exposure for brief periods at first—perhaps as little as five
As you become more used to focusing on feelings you will be able to tolerate emotion
It will also strengthen mindfulness skills and
Remember the key steps to doing the Emotion Exposure exercise are
Notice how you feel inside your body
Notice and describe your emotion
Notice if the feeling is growing or diminishing see it like a wave
Describe any new emotions or changes in quality
Notice any need to block the emotion but keep watching
Notice impulses to act on your emotion but keep watching without acting
Notice judgments about self others or the emotion itself and let them go
Keep watching until the emotion either changes or diminishes
Finish with a few minutes of mindful breathing
Example Using Mindfulness of Your Emotions and Emotion Exposure
They were now coparenting Adam’s seven and tenyearold children with the kids ­spending
Virtually every time they had contact Adam’s ex said something that enraged him
And it didn’t end there
He seethed for days afterwards plotting what he
The Being Mindful of Your Emotions Without Judgment exercise seemed daunting to Adam
And his doctor had recently warned
He started by focusing on current emotions—nothing to do
As Adam observed his sadness he became conscious of a heavy feeling in his abdomen and
He had a sudden image of himself carrying a great weight
Noticing the judgments and letting them go became easier after a few
And Adam gained confidence in his ability to calm himself with
Emotion exposure was more challenging
For this exercise Adam chose to work on feelings
His first emotion exposure incident followed a phone call where
Adam began by noticing the effect of these words on his body
He felt hot with a disturbing sense of pressure in the chest and neck
He wondered if it was his blood pressure
It felt hard and sharp surging up with deep disgust
As the despair got stronger Adam noticed an impulse to turn it off to block it
Adam was also aware of impulses to act on the despair
He wanted to get angry instead to
While Adam observed his feelings judgments kept coming up
His ex was evil he had been
After a time Adam noticed something that surprised him
The despair feeling if he didn’t
It softened to a feeling closer to regret
Adam now returned the focus to his breathing counting and observing each breath
DOING THE OPPOSITE OF YOUR
There are good reasons for feeling whatever it is you feel
Even when they are painful your emotions are legitimate and valid
The larger problem is emotiondriven behavior because acting on
Letting anger drive you to attack with words can
Letting fear drive you to avoid critical tasks and challenges can paralyze
A second problem with acting on emotiondriven impulses is that they intensify your original
Instead of getting relief you may get even more consumed with the emotion
Rather than fueling your emotion opposite action helps to regulate and
Here are some examples of opposite action
Approach what you fear do
Shut down avoid be passive
Be active get involved set
Notice that opposite action changes both body language posture facial expression and
Opposite action isn’t about denying or pretending an emotion isn’t happening
Rather it is about regulation
You acknowledge the emotion but use the opposite behavior to reduce
Start by acknowledging what you feel
Describe the emotion in words
Ask yourself if there’s a good reason to regulate or reduce the intensity of this emotion
Does it drive you to do dangerous or destructive things
What are you saying and how are you saying it
How can you change your posture to convey confidence and
How can you move toward not away from what scares
When you are angry how can you acknowledge or ignore rather than attack
Fully commit to opposite action and set a time frame to work at it
As you think about making a commitment keep in
What’s happened in the past when you
Were there serious costs to you to others
As you do opposite action notice how the original emotion may
Opposite action literally sends a message to the brain that the old
Now it’s time to do some advanced planning
Filling out the OppositeAction Planning Worksheet is simple but potentially very important
In it you’ll identify emotions you can expect to feel in the future and prepare a radically different
Remember Linda and the Emotion Log she filled out just before Christmas
When she began working on her OppositeAction Planning Worksheet she identified several opposite actions that she thought might help with her anger feelings of rejection and guilt
EXAMPLE LINDA’S OPPOSITEACTION PLANNING WORKSHEET
Over several weeks Linda monitored her oppositeaction outcomes to see how the new
What she found was that her anger passed more quickly when she followed her
Using a quiet voice and saying out loud what hurt her seemed to soften the
At first she had been afraid to acknowledge her feelings of rejection because it made her
And she spent less time ruminating about ways she felt victimized
We won’t pretend that it is
But opposite action quickly dulls the
Fear often turns to empowerment sadness to engagement
Sometimes emotion regulation has to start before the overwhelming feelings begin
Problem solving begins with something called behavior analysis
Worksheet will take you step by step through the process
When he did a behavior analysis of his anger reactions Sam found multiple internal triggers
Problematic emotion Rage at motherinlaw
She looks disgusted when she sees my house
The yard is full of weeds and rundown looking
Thought I hate this place
Thoughts Why do I spend my life in dumps like this
Why can’t I do better than this
The point here is that you can change or soften overwhelming emotions by changing what
The first step after completing your behavior analysis
This must be 1 an
In Sam’s case he decided to do something about his shamegenerating thoughts and the
Sam realized that all too often over the years this same pattern had repeated itself
He’d start with selfshaming thoughts which would soon feel intolerably
Then he’d try to mask the shame by finding fault with others which would trigger anger
Once you’ve identified the precipitating or secondary events you want to change using your
Precipitating event what happened before the emotion
Thoughts What thoughts prior to the emotion might have triggered or intensified your
Emotion Was there a prior and different emotion that triggered your reaction
Behavior Was something you or someone else did a trigger for your reaction
When you complete a Behavior Analysis Worksheet you’ll see how emotions are built
Sometimes that trigger is internal—like your thoughts or ­feelings—
This is the second step of problem solving after you’ve completed your Behavioral Analysis
It will teach you to identify the ABCs of problem solving
How could you change precipitating or
Evaluate your list and choose one or two of your best ideas to implement
Identify the time and place you’ll try your new responses
Write out the new thoughts or behavior you’ll use
Let’s go through the problemsolving steps with Sam as an example
Sam had two brainstorming lists—one to replace his shametriggering thoughts and the other to change his attacking
Think of things I do right
Remind myself how crazy this makes
Validate the person before saying
Distract myself listen to music
Never say anything critical if I’m feeling
Ask Millie his wife for support
Give written not verbal feedback
Take a drive take some pictures
Remember how the other person would
Check with Millie about whether I’m
Sam evaluated the different ideas he’d come up with and decided to try the following
I’ll distract myself with music or get involved in my photography
I’ll run things past Millie before getting on anyone’s case and I’ll give thoughtout
Finally Sam decided to follow his plan with his motherinlaw for the rest of his visit
Notice that Sam developed specific alternative behaviors to replace key actions that ­happened
The most important thing about problem solving is to know exactly what you’re going to do
The more concrete and specific you are the better
Now using your own example from your Behavioral Analysis Worksheet work through the same
Emotion regulation is best achieved when you employ your new skills on a regular basis
Noticing and remembering positive events
Relationships are precious and they are vulnerable
They bring love companionship and
Yet sometimes in a matter of moments they can become broken beyond repair
The most necessary and important of these skills is assertiveness which is the ability
Before learning assertiveness however there are some key things you need to know
Whether it’s a lover friend coworker or merely a carpool companion maintaining a good relationship depends on noticing the other person’s feelings and reactions
Using the mindfulness skills you practiced in chapters
3 through 5 you can observe facial expression body language tone of voice and choice of words
Paying attention means staying in the here and now—not thinking about what you want to
It means remaining present to what you see hear and sense
In the same way that you can breathe walk or even do dishes mindfully you can
When you pay attention you notice trouble
Not paying attention—focusing away from the moment between you and others—has a heavy
You’ll end up doing one or more of the following
Missing vital cues about the other person’s needs and reactions
Projecting inaccurately your fears and feelings on the other
Blowing up or running away when “surprised” by a negative response you could
Mindful attention also involves watching your own experience in relation to others
Noticing your feelings can help you figure out what needs to change in a
In summary then the first interpersonal skill you need to cultivate is mindful attention
In the very next conversation you have practice being an observer of the moment by attending to
If you find anything ambiguous or hard to read
How are things between us
Is everything okay with you
How could you say it in a way that preserves the relationship
Bill had noticed his girlfriend Gina looking away from him during dinner
“How are things between us” she told him that she’d been hurt not to be invited to his office
This gave him a chance to explain that he hated company events and only planned
These interpersonal patterns have a huge impact on your relationships
You go along with what the other person expects
Long term however passivity is the
When you give in to others and abandon your own needs it
Eventually the relationship becomes so
The paradox of being passive is that
Long term however the relationship
In comparison aggressive behaviors also destroy relationships because they push people away
An aggressive interpersonal style derives from two sources
The first is a strong sense of the way
In particular you are acutely aware of how others ought to behave
The second source of aggression is a need to control interpersonal events
You apply more pressure to control what happens
At times you may feel so determined
Passivity and aggression both destroy relationships
Either one of these patterns ends up being
The assertiveness skills you’ll be introduced to in the
They will give you the tools to seek what you need in relationships
Think back over recent interactions in your five most significant relationships
I go along with something even if I don’t like it
I push people to do what’s right even if there’s an upset
I try to be pleasant and easygoing no matter what people do or say
I give people a piece of my mind when they deserve it
I always try to be sensitive to what other people need and feel even if my own needs
I know what I want and insist on it even if it means having to get angry
When there’s a conflict I tend to give in and let things go the other person’s way
When people don’t do what’s appropriate or reasonable I don’t let them get away
I’ll pull away from a relationship rather than say anything that could be upsetting
You can’t let people continue being selfish or stupid you have to shake them till they
If people ignore my needs or insist on things that don’t work for me I get more and
I leave people alone let them be whatever they are
If you tended to mark odd numbers your predominant style is passive if you checked even
Every relationship consists of two people trying to get what they need
But when they need different things at the same time or when one of them needs something the other doesn’t want to
For relationships to succeed you must be able to do the following
Know and say what you desire
Notice or find out what the other person desires
Negotiate and compromise so you can get at least some of what you want
Give what you can of what the other person wants
If the “I want–they want” ratio isn’t balanced your relationship becomes unstable
The following exercise will help you assess the “I want–they want” ratio
Choose one relationship you want to evaluate
In the lefthand column fill in the things you want and need in that
Under “Outcome” assess how well those needs are met
In the two righthand columns do
Now take a look at the outcomes on each side of the chart
How does the relationship deal with those
Are they ignored or negotiated
“I WANT –I SHOULD” RATIO
Every relationship requires keeping a delicate balance between seeking what you want to do and
They’re so busy being good and giving that they fail to notice how depressed and desperate
Sooner or later the pain of denying yourself grows too big and you have to escape
Put a check  next to the items that describe your beliefs or feelings
You should try to give everything that’s asked of you in a relationship even when it means
When someone is in pain you should do anything required to help them
You should be caring and considerate at all times
You shouldn’t ask for something if you know the other person doesn’t want to give it
There is a right way to act with people and it should be followed even if it means keeping
You shouldn’t say no to people it’s impolite
You shouldn’t express feelings that might upset someone it’s wrong
You should respond to the needs of others because their needs are a high priority
You should never hurt or offend anyone
You should try not to disappoint others
The more items you checked the stronger your beliefs about the right and wrong way to relate
Improving your interpersonal skills will take hard work
You don’t need anyone to tell you how
But you know why it’s important—some relationships
Practicing your new interpersonal skills will yield the following
Help you be more effective in your dealings with people
Help you negotiate conflicts without damaging a relationship
Strengthen your selfrespect by giving you alternatives to old damaging patterns
There are six core interpersonal skills that will change how your relationships feel

Acting in your relationships according to what you value is another
Don’t be surprised when valueless relationships don’t work out well
Exercise Identify Your Interpersonal Values
On the following lines list any of your interpersonal behaviors that diminish selfrespect
Also write down sins of omission—
Example I get angry as soon as someone criticizes me
Now in the space that follows list your values regarding how people should be treated
When you compare the two lists assess whether you’re using interpersonal strategies that
Which core values do you disregard most frequently
How are your relationships impacted when you violate your values
In the next chapter you will learn interpersonal strategies that will help you be effective while
BLOCKS TO USING INTERPERSONAL SKILLS
Despite how diligent you are about using your new interpersonal skills there will still be many
Once you know what they are you can prepare
Here are some of the most common blocks to using interpersonal skills
Old habits—of the aggressive kind
Old habits—of the passive kind
Failure to identify your needs
Old Habits—of the Aggressive Kind
In your family of origin you observed how people solved interpersonal problems and you
Techniques for influencing others that utilize fear shame or hurtful psychological pressure
There are eight of them
Discounting The message to the other person is that his or her needs or feelings are
Here’s an example “You’ve been watching TV all day why do you expect me to come home and do the bills”
Withdrawingabandoning The message is “Do what I want or I’m leaving” The fear of
Threatening The message here is “Do what I want or I’ll hurt you” The most typical
Blaming The problem whatever it is becomes the other person’s fault
Belittlingdenigrating The strategy here is to make the other person feel foolish and wrong
Guilttripping This strategy conveys the message that the other person is a moral failure
Derailing This strategy switches attention away from the other person’s feelings and
The idea is to stop talking about them and instead talk about yourself
Taking away Here the strategy is to withdraw some form of support pleasure or reinforcement from the other person as punishment for something they said did or wanted
Here’s an example John said “I’m not really in the mood for hiking it’s boring” after
As you review this list are there strategies you recognize from your own behavior
The following Conflict Log will help you
Some old habits are of the passive rather than aggressive variety
You may have learned in
You can use the same Conflict
After keeping the log ask these questions
Which strategies do you most frequently rely on
What are the most frequent emotional consequences for using these strategies
The assertiveness skills in the next chapter will give you more effective alternatives to the
A third major block to using interpersonal skills is high emotion
Sometimes your best intentions and most carefully laid plans go up in smoke when you’re upset
“It didn’t feel like me telling my wife to get out” one man insisted
What can you do when overwhelming emotion threatens to unravel
There are two things you can learn to do right now
Here are some that are typical
Tension in your hands arms forehead or shoulders
Talking more rapidly or more loudly than usual
Feeling a strong need to win to crush someone to make them feel bad
Make a list in the following space of redflag feelings or behaviors that in the past signaled a loss
Now when conflicts arise watch out for the red flags
If you notice them you can use a second
Failure to Identify Your Needs
Interpersonal skills won’t do you much good if you don’t know what you want in a situation
If you can’t clearly articulate your needs all you’re left with is frustration
The first section of the
Once you can articulate a need to yourself the sections on assertiveness and
When you feel afraid of something interpersonal skills often go out the window
What if I lose my job
Or they can cause you to avoid a situation altogether
The net result is that you don’t
Wisemind meditation see page 87 can help you manage in the face of fear as can mindful
Another thing you can do is directly confront your catastrophic thoughts
Notice that the Risk AssessmentRisk Planning Worksheet on the next page is divided into four
In column one write down your fear and in column two list all the evidence you have
In column three write down all available evidence that the catastrophe won’t occur
Now after reviewing evidence for and against write your estimate of the percentage of chance that the catastrophe will happen
In the “Risk Planning” portion of the worksheet imagine that the catastrophe you fear has actually happened

The last of the major blocks to using interpersonal skills is found in the four paralyzing myths
If I need something it means there is something wrong or bad about me
I won’t be able to stand it if the other person gets mad or says no
It’s selfish to say no or ask for things
I have no control over anything
Each of these myths inhibits you from saying what you need and setting limits
Every human being needs things from other human beings—whether it’s
We are not sufficient unto
So needing things can’t be shameful or wrong it is basic to the human condition
In contrast to this myth a healthy
Hearing an angry refusal hurts
Sometimes it hits so hard and suddenly
But is it true you can’t stand it
Refusals hurt there’s no doubt about it but the worst thing is living with years
In contrast to this myth a
You may feel that it’s selfish to ask for things because of messages in your
When you examine it is this really true
The truth is that everyone’s needs are valid and equally important
You can’t control the behavior of others even though
What can be controlled is your behavior
People ignore your needs or get angry
That’s why you feel helpless—the strategies you’re using aren’t effective
Assertive behavior gets better results
People—more often than not—listen and
In contrast to this myth a helpful alternative coping thought is
“I can choose to behave in more effective ways”

For our purposes here you can identify
It starts with the basic
If the feeling is good is it more like
If the feeling is bad is it more like anxiety fear anger resentment sadness
The decision tree looks like this
Anger or disgust with oneself
Allan for example was aware that something felt wrong in his relationship with his father
Allan could tell it somehow related to his father’s planned visit
Yet in five days of sightseeing his dad had scheduled just a single
Once you can put words to what you feel the next question becomes what does
And more specifically what is the behavior of others that
Do you want them to do more or less of something
Do you want new behavior that could make a difference in how you feel
Now think about the behavior change in specific terms
What exactly would the new behavior look like
Now let’s condense this process into a series of steps
Think of a recent experience where you had a bad feeling during an interaction
Put the feeling into words
What do you want the other person to change
Now put all this information into one or more clear sentences
A woman whose sister frequently criticized how she parented a difficult child wrote this
I’d like her to stop it in particular
The problem with getting clear and specific about your desires is that it brings up anxiety
Do you deserve to ask for things
All of this entitles you to be heard
Unfortunately many people grow up in families that invalidate their needs
You have a right to need things from others
You have a right to put yourself first sometimes
You have a right to feel and express your emotions or your pain
You have the right to be the final judge of your beliefs and accept them as legitimate
You have the right to your opinions and convictions
You have the right to your experience—even if it’s different from that of other people
You have a right to protest any treatment or criticism that feels bad to you
You have a right to negotiate for change
You have a right to say no saying no doesn’t make you bad or selfish
You have a right not to justify yourself to others
You have a right not to take responsibility for someone else’s problem
You have a right to choose not to respond to a situation
You have a right sometimes to inconvenience or disappoint others
Put the rights that are most important or liberating to you on a file card and tape it someplace where you’ll see it frequently like your bathroom mirror in order to remind yourself
How you ask for things depends on the situation
The intensity and level of insistence can vary
How urgent is my need
How vulnerable is the other person or the relationship
Notice that you can assess each of these variables with a tenpoint scale
The lower the number the more moderate and
Think of some recent situations where you’ve needed another person to change
What can you learn about the appropriate
Did you use too much—or too little—in certain situations
Ask yourself these two questions during every situation where you need to express yourself
While you may not always have the time or inclination to use the 1 to 10 rating system remembering “how urgent” and “how vulnerable” can help you make splitsecond decisions about how
During this exercise Rachel evaluated some problematic discussions with her husband
Rachel realized that her gentle easygoing approach
The skill of making a request is necessary to taking care of yourself
If you have trouble making such requests you can easily end up feeling helpless or
There are four components to a brief request
Explain in one sentence what the problem is
Many situations don’t need any justification when they do keep it simple
Softening statements often start like this
“Would you mind if …”
“It would be helpful if you could …”
“I’d appreciate it if you would …”
Said with a smile “Could I have …”
“Hi I was wondering if …”
Notice that these openers are disarming
They’re far less likely to encounter resistance than a hardedged demand
You say what you want clearly and exactly
Say what you want in a flat matterof factway
This reinforces the behavior of the other person saying yes to
It makes them feel that you value what they’re doing
“This will really help me out”
“Thanks for your effort with this”
“This will make a real difference”
When the components are strung together simple requests can look like these
Would you mind lowering the shade a
Could you please move your briefcase off the
Would it be okay with you to leave a little more room between us and the car in
If you sometimes find making requests challenging you can practice in lots of everyday situations
Try some of these suggestions
On the street Asking for the time for directions where someone bought a particular article of clothing for change
At home Asking for a change in schedule for assistance for time together for
With friends and family Asking for a favor for time for a ride for someone to stop
With a teacher or therapist Asking for information for help with a problem for
Either at breakfast or just before going to bed identify the next day’s
Decide on the time and situation in which you plan to practice
As you read in the last chapter assertiveness is a critical skill to maintaining healthy relationships
Without it you’ll be forced into passive or aggressive patterns that destroy the fabric of trust and
Assertiveness is most easily learned by using a simple script
It will help you give structure to
A script also has the advantage of permitting you to
There are three basic components to an assertiveness statement and one optional
“I think” is a clear description of events and experiences that you
“You’ve billed me for a repair I didn’t authorize”
“Im getting back from the airport late—around 1100 o’clock—and …”
Notice that there isn’t much hint of emotion in these statements and there’s no
“I feel” This is an optional component that you’d likely use with a friend or family
That’s because it’s about you and
Appropriately any sentence about your emotions should start
“Lately I feel sad about us”
“I feel hurt with a twinge of giving up”
“I feel kind of lost and invisible and more and more disconnected”
“I feel hopeful but nervous”
Each example while naming feelings of varied complexity never makes the other
That doesn’t work—it just makes people defensive and less willing
Accusations and blame statements often start with the word
“You don’t care about us”
Some people dress up “you” statements to look like “I” statements
“I feel that you’re selfish”
“I feel that you’re never home”
“I feel that you manipulate me”
Notice that a judgment not a feeling forms the core of such communications
“I want” This component is the whole point of assertiveness and you need to think it
Here are some guidelines to follow
Ask for behavioral not attitudinal change
You can’t reasonably expect someone
But you can ask someone to
Ask for one change at a time
Don’t give a laundry list
Ask for something that can be changed now
Vague requests like “Be nicer” don’t get you anywhere
Selfcare solution optional Just asking for things isn’t always enough
The encouragement that works best is a fourth optional component of your
This amounts to nothing more than telling
The selfcare solution isn’t the same thing as threatening someone or punishing
Its purpose is to give information and show that you’re not helpless that you have
“If you can’t leave for the party on time I’ll take my own car”
None of these selfcare solutions are designed to hurt the other person they’re
Integrating the Components of Being Assertive
Now let’s integrate the components of an assertive statement so you can see how they fit
I feel	I feel left out because the company’s doing well and I’m not participating in that
I want	I’d like a 10 percent costofliving adjustment soon so my income can keep pace with
If we can’t work this out I’m going to have to look for something else so I can better
I think	I’ve been working against a deadline tonight and haven’t had time to cook dinner
I’m pretty anxious and overwhelmed that I might not get this done
Could you whip something together from leftovers so I can keep going
Selfcare If that doesn’t work for you I can order a pizza
One way to use your selfcare solution is to hold it in reserve—only using it if the other person
Saving the “big guns” for later is often an effective strategy
Now it’s time to practice developing your own scripts
Start with identifying three situations in
Write the information down in the
How I’ll take care of myself
How I’ll take care of myself
How I’ll take care of myself
Everyone knows that good communication is a twoway street
But what a lot of people don’t know
It requires a full commitment to really
In other words the same three things you’re learning to express assertively you’ll also need to
If while listening you have any uncertainty about the other person’s feelings or wishes ask a
The more active your questions the more you learn and the better equipped you’ll be to
Key questions to ask others are as
“What’s the central problem as you understand it”
“What do you think needs to change”
“What would you like me to do to help with this”
For example Ron noticed that a coworker seemed irritated with a new orderprocessing system
When Ron asked “What do you think needs to change” he got a wealth
Assertive listening is extremely valuable but remember—just because you found out what
Right now put a check  by the listening blocks you’re aware of using
In the lefthand column of the following table describe three situations where communications
In the righthand column see if you can identify at
During the next week notice how often you use your favorite listening blocks
Without it any relationship is
You have no control over
The words are simple but often it takes
Let’s start with the “how” of saying no
There are only two steps
Validate the other person’s needs or desires
State a clear preference not to do it
Notice that the key phrases are “I’d prefer” and “I’m not comfortable” You don’t offer a lot
You just validate and decline
No one can really argue with
Exercise Building an Assertive Hierarchy
Learning assertiveness including saying no takes practice and willingness to take some risks
Make a list of situations where you want to make a change say no or set limits
Write your script “I think … I feel … I want”
Identify the time and place you want to use it
Commit yourself to making your assertive statement on a specific date
When you’ve completed your first assertive goal evaluate what worked and what needs improvement
For example do you need to be firmer with less arguing or excuse making
Keep moving up the hierarchy
As you do you’ll find your confidence and skill growing
COPING WITH RESISTANCE AND CONFLICT
We looked earlier at how to improve your ability to hear others
But what happens if someone isn’t
The answer is in the following five conflict management skills
When people aren’t listening to you one of the most common reasons is that they feel invalidated
They don’t experience that they’re being heard so they keep pouring on their arguments
You can shortcircuit the problem with mutual validation
It means instead that you understand their needs feelings and
You get it—you see how the other person could think and feel that way
On my end I feel a pressure to make some higheryield investments so
We’re both coming from a reasonable place
On my end I’m scared this project is
I appreciate that very much
On my end I’ve got a budget so tight I can’t
Notice that each example of mutual validation includes a sentence that starts “I understand”
You use this technique when someone isn’t getting the message
Ideally keep it to one sentence
Stand or sit straight talk in a strong firm voice
Don’t argue don’t get angry and don’t try to debate or refute anything the other person says
Just repeat politely and clearly like a broken record
Sam	I think that branch is a danger to my house and I’d like you to have it removed
Relax that branch will still be up there long after we’re pushing up daisies
I’m asking you to remove
Why have you gotten so nervous about it all of a sudden
The branch is over my roof Bill and it needs to come down
The key phrase here is this
Just keep asking it until you get something useful
For example let’s return to a previous example of a person who was accused of not pulling
Imagine that you were criticized in that way
Here’s how probing could help you
You’re not pulling your weight around here
What is it about my work that bothers you
You waltz out every night at 500
What is it that bothers you about me leaving the office on time
I’m responsible to see that it is
And you just work by
What is it that bothers you when I work by the clock
I want you to stay till
I appreciate your explaining to me
If you wish to probe with more varied questions review the sample queries in the Assertive
This technique allows you to “agree in part” with someone without accepting that everything
This calms people down and stops the winlose arguing game
The key is to find some part of what’s being said that you can accept and then to acknowledge
Ignore the rest of their argument
One way to agree is
You always get pissed off over little things
It’s true there are times I find myself getting irritated
You never support me when I need something
Notice how clouding steals your critic’s thunder and neutralizes his or her argument
This technique gives you room to wait particularly when things threaten to get hot and
People will often pressure you to make a decision or agree with a plan right away
When a conflict arises that requires negotiation between you and someone else you need to start
The RAVEN checklist will keep you on track
RAVEN stands for the following
Take a deep breath before you say the next thing
Validate the other person’s need or concern
Focus on a fair mutually agreeable outcome
How do you want to be treated in a relationship—how do you want
What do you want to achieve not only regarding the conflict but in this
Keep anger and contempt out of your voice
Once you’re committed to staying within the RAVEN guidelines it’s time to start the actual
It begins by each person taking turns and offering solutions
Here are some classic compromise solutions
I’ll cut the pie you choose the first piece
After the divorce Sharon divided the
Linda and Moe alternated between going to the mountains and the
Do both have it all
Take care of both people’s needs simultaneously
Agree to a solution only for a specific length of time after which you’ll
If one party feels the solution isn’t working negotiations are reopened
My way when I’m doing it your way when you’re doing it
Each person as he or she
Sam and Katrina were partners
Sam thought the big “come on in” sign that Katrina made was
They agreed he wouldn’t use it on his days watching the store
Roommates Jill and Denise agreed that if Jill cleaned the bathroom once
Part of what I want with part of what you want
Two friends and coworkers planned
One wanted to relax on the train one wanted
They agreed to fly one way and take the train the
This often works with haggling over a price or how much time
Recall three recent conflicts where you had very different needs from someone else
For each conflict work out two possible compromises from the above list
Describe specifically how you would
When working toward compromise it’s crucial to maintain flexibility
Be open to creative unexpected solutions
HOW TO ANALYZE PROBLEM INTERACTIONS
You need a way to figure out what happened when communications go wrong
Sometimes you will blow up or shut down
The following checklist will help you review interpersonal problems and become clearer about
Were you clear about your goals
Did you know what you wanted
Did you know what you didn’t want—so you could say no
Did you use passive strategies
What were the blocking factors
High emotion see page 192
Fear and “what ifs” see page 193
Toxic relationships see page 196
If I need something it means there is something wrong or bad about
I won’t be able to stand it if the other person gets mad or says no
It’s selfish to say no or ask for things
I have no control over anything
Judgments instead of facts see page 206

The Communication Effectiveness Checklist is a starting point to evaluate interactions that
Identify the problems first then decide which ones you want to
Review the sections in this and the previous chapter regarding skills you want to improve
Finally make a specific plan for how you are going to change your behavior next time
Just focus on a few changes that might

Laura used the Communication Effectiveness Checklist to evaluate an
She had asked for lighter duties because of a sprained wrist
Denigrating I told him the company didn’t take very good care of its employees
High emotion I got quickly upset and forgot some of my skills
Myths I feel like there’s something wrong with me if I ask for anything special
“You” statements I said “I feel like you don’t really care what happens to people”
Blocks to listening I used judging and sparring
Mutual validation I didn’t validate his concerns
Probing I never found out his concerns
Laura realized she couldn’t deal with everything on her list so she decided to focus on just
When I discuss this with Bob again I’m going to do the following
Be extremely careful to make no critical statements about Bob or the company—no matter
Do a few minutes of mindful breathing to calm down before I talk to him
Watch out for when I feel hot or I’m raising my voice—take a couple of deep breaths to calm
Tell him I can do anything but collating copying and working with a mouse
If he objects I’ll ask what his concern is about temporarily changing my duties
The most important thing to remember about your new interpersonal skills is to keep working
Your persistence will benefit you
Shrug it off when things go wrong figure out what happened and then make a new plan
You have the ability to change your relationships and your life
All you have to do is keep trying
The skills you have learned in this book will grow stronger each day that you practice them
Conversely if your skills aren’t used they’ll slip further from your grasp
