Skills Training Assumptions
An assumption is a belief that cannot be proved,
but we agree to abide by it anyway.

1. People are doing the best they can.
All people at any given point in time are doing the best they can.
2. People want to improve.
The common characteristic of all people is that they want to improve their lives and be happy.
3. People need to do better, try harder, and be more motivated to change.*
The fact that people are doing the best they can, and want to do even better, does not mean
that these things are enough to solve the problem.
4. People may not have caused all of our own problems, but they have to solve them
anyway.**
People have to change their own behavioral responses and alter their environment for their life
to change.
5. New behavior has to be learned in all relevant contexts.
New behavioral skills have to be practiced in the situations where the skills are needed, not just
in the situation where the skills are first learned.
6. All behaviors (actions, thoughts, emotions) are caused.
There is always a cause or set of causes for our actions, thoughts, and emotions, even if we do
not know what the causes are.
7. Figuring out and changing the causes of behavior work better than judging and blaming.
Judging and blaming are easier, but if we want to create change in the world, we have to
change the chains of events that cause unwanted behaviors and events.

*But trying harder and being more motivated may not be needed if progress is steady and at a realistic rate of improvement.
**Parents and caregivers must assist children in this task.

General Handout 5

(p. 1 of 2)

Biosocial Theory
Why do I have so much trouble controlling
my emotions and my actions?

Emotional vulnerability is biological:
It’s simply how some people are born.

They are more sensitive to emotional stimuli; they can detect subtle
emotional information in the environment that others don’t even notice.

They experience emotions much more often than others.

Their emotions seem to hit for no reason, from out of the blue.

They have more intense emotions.

Their emotions hit like a ton of bricks.

And their emotions are long-­lasting.

Impulsivity also has a biological basis:
Regulating action is harder for some than for others.

They find it very hard to restrain impulsive behaviors.

Often, without thinking, they do things that get them in trouble.

Sometimes their behavior seems to come out of nowhere.

They find it very hard to be effective.

Their moods get in the way of organizing to achieve their goals.

They cannot control behaviors linked to their moods.

General Handout 5

(p. 2 of 2)

An invalidating social environment
can make it very hard to regulate emotions.

An invalidating environment doesn’t seem to understand your emotions.

It tells you your emotions are invalid, weird, wrong, or bad.

It often ignores your emotional reactions and does nothing to help you.

It may say things like “Don’t be such a baby!” “Quit your blubbering.” “Quit
being such a chicken and just solve the problem.” or “Normal people don’t
get this frustrated.”

People who invalidate are often doing the best they can.

They may not know how to validate or how important it is to validate, or
they may be afraid that if they validate your emotions, you will get more
emotional, not less.

They may be under high stress or time pressure, or they may have too
few resources themselves.

There may be just a poor fit between you and your social environment:
You may be a tulip in a rose garden.

An ineffective social environment
is a big problem when you want
to learn to regulate emotions and actions.

Your environment may reinforce out-of-­control emotions and actions.

If people give in when you get out of control, it will be hard for you to get in
control.

If others command you to change, but don’t coach you on how to do this,
it will be hard to keep on trying to change.

It’s the transactions that count
between the person and the social environment.

Biology and the social environment influence the person.

The person reciprocates and influences his or her social environment.

The social environment reciprocates and influences the person.

And so on and on and on.

Overview:
Analyzing Behavior

To figure out its causes
and plan for problem solving.

Chain Analysis
is for when you engage in ineffective behavior.
A chain analysis examines the chain of events that leads to
ineffective behaviors, as well as the consequences of those
behaviors that may be making it hard to change them. It also
helps you figure out how to repair the damage.

Missing-Links Analysis
is for when you fail to engage in effective behaviors.
A missing-links analysis helps you identify what got in the way of
doing things you needed or hoped to do, things you agreed to do,
or things others expected you to do. It also helps you problemsolve for the future.

Chain Analysis, Step by Step
1. Describe the specific problem behavior (overeating or overdrinking, yelling at your
kids, throwing a chair, having an overwhelming emotional outburst, dissociating, not coming or
coming late to skills training, putting off or refusing to do skills practice, etc.).
A. Be very specific and detailed. No vague terms.
B. Identify exactly what you did, said, thought, or felt (if feelings are the targeted problem
behavior). Identify what you did not do.
C. Describe the intensity of the behavior and other characteristics of the behavior that are
important.
D. Describe the problem behavior in enough detail that an actor in a play or movie could
recreate the behavior exactly.
E. If the behavior is something you did not do, ask yourself whether (a) you did not know you
needed to do it (it did not get into short-term memory); (b) you forgot it and later it never
came into your mind to do it (it did not get into long-term memory); (c) you put it off when
you did think of it; (d) you refused to do it when you thought of it; or (e) you were willful and
rejected doing it, or some other behavior, thoughts, or emotions interfered with doing it. If (a)
or (b) is the case, skip from here to Step 6 below (working on solutions). Otherwise, keep
going from here.
2. Describe the specific prompting event that started the whole chain of behavior. Begin
with the environmental event that started the chain. Always begin with some event in your
environment, even if it doesn’t seem to you that the environmental event “caused” the problem
behavior. Otherwise, we could ask about any behavior, thought, feeling, or experience, “What
prompted that?” Possible questions to help you get at this are:
A. What exact event precipitated the start of the chain reaction?
B. When did the sequence of events that led to the problem behavior begin? When did the
problem start?
C. What was going on right before the thought of or impulse for the problem behavior occurred?
D. What were you doing/thinking/feeling/imagining at that time?
E. Why did the problem behavior happen on that day instead of the day before?
3. Describe specific vulnerability factors happening before the prompting event.
What factors or events made you more vulnerable to reacting to the prompting event with a
problematic chain? Areas to examine are:
A. Physical illness; unbalanced eating or sleeping; injury.
B. Use of drugs or alcohol; misuse of prescription drugs.
C. Stressful events in the environment (either positive or negative).
D. Intense emotions, such as sadness, anger, fear, loneliness.
E. Previous behaviors of your own that you found stressful coming into your mind.

General Handout 7a

(p. 2 of 2)

4. Describe in excruciating detail the chain of events that led to the problem behavior.
Imagine that your problem behavior is chained to the precipitating event in the environment.
How long is the chain? Where does it go? What are the links? Write out all links in the chain of
events, no matter how small. Be very specific, as if you are writing a script for a play. Links in
the chain can be:
A. Actions or things you do.
B. Body sensations or feelings.
C. Cognitions (i.e., beliefs, expectations, or thoughts).
D. Events in the environment or things others do.
E. Feelings and emotions that you experience.
What exact thought (or belief), feeling, or action followed the prompting event? What thought,
feeling, or action followed that? What next? What next? And so forth.
•• Look at each link in the chain after you write it. Was there another thought, feeling, or action
that could have occurred? Could someone else have thought, felt, or acted differently at that
point? If so, explain how that specific thought, feeling, or action came to be.
•• For each link in the chain, ask whether there is a smaller link you could describe.
5. Describe the consequences of this behavior. Be specific. (How did other people react
immediately and later? How did you feel immediately following the behavior? Later? What effect
did the behavior have on you and your environment?)
6. Describe in detail at each point where you could have used a skillful behavior to head off the
problem behavior. What key links were most important in leading to the problem behavior? (In
other words, if you had eliminated these behaviors, the problem behavior probably would not
have happened.)
A. Go back to the chain of behaviors following the prompting event. Circle each link where, if
you had done something different, you would have avoided the problem behavior.
B. What could you have done differently at each link in the chain of events to avoid the problem
behavior? What coping behaviors or skillful behaviors could you have used?
7. Describe in detail a prevention strategy for how you could have kept the chain from
starting by reducing your vulnerability to the chain.
8. Describe what you are going to do to repair important or significant consequences of the
problem behavior.
A. Analyze: What did you really harm? What was the negative consequence you can repair?
B. Look at the harm or distress you actually caused others, and the harm or distress you
caused yourself. Repair what you damaged. (Don’t bring flowers to repair a window you
broke: fix the window! Repair a betrayal of trust by being very trustworthy long enough to fit
the betrayal, rather than trying to fix it with love letters and constant apologies. Repair failure
by succeeding, not by berating yourself.)

Missing-Links Analysis
Ask the following questions to understand how and why
effective behavior that is needed or expected did not occur.
1. Did you know what effective behavior was needed or expected (what skills
homework was given, what skills to use, etc.)?
If no to Question 1, ask what got in the way of knowing what was needed or expected.
Ideas might include not paying attention, unclear instructions, never getting the instructions
in the first place, becoming too overwhelmed and couldn’t process the information, and so
on.
Problem-solve what got in the way. For example, you might work on paying
attention, ask for clarification when you don’t understand instructions, call others, look
up information, and so on.

2. If yes to Question 1, ask were you willing to do the needed or expected effective
behavior?
If no to Question 2, ask what got in the way of willingness to do effective behaviors.
Ideas might include willfulness, feeling inadequate, or feeling demoralized.
Problem-solve what got in the way of willingness. For example, you might practice
radical acceptance, do pros and cons, practice opposite action, and so on.

3. If yes to Question 2, ask did the thought of doing the needed or expected effective
behavior ever enter your mind?
If no to Question 3,
Problem-solve how to get the thought of doing effective behaviors into your mind.
For example, you might put it on your calendar, set your alarm to go off, put your skills
notebook next to your bed, practice coping ahead with difficult situations (see Emotion
Regulation Handout 19), and so on.

4. If yes to Question 3, ask what got in the way of doing the needed or expected
effective behavior right away? Ideas might include putting it off, continuing to
procrastinate, not being in the mood, forgetting how to do what was needed, thinking that
no one would care anyway (or no one would find out), and so on.
Problem-solve what got in the way. For example, you might set a reward for doing
what is expected, practice opposite action, do pros and cons, and so on.

Mindfulness Definitions
What Is Mindfulness?
•• Intentionally living with awareness in the present moment.
(Waking up from automatic or rote behaviors to participate and be present to our own lives.)
•• Without judging or rejecting the moment.
(Noticing consequences, discerning helpfulness and harmfulness—but letting go of evaluating,
avoiding, suppressing, or blocking the present moment.)
•• Without attachment to the moment.
(Attending to the experience of each new moment, rather than ignoring the present by clinging
to the past or grabbing for the future.)

What Are Mindfulness Skills?
•• Mindfulness skills are the specific behaviors to practice that, when put together, make up
mindfulness.

What Is Mindfulness Practice?
•• Mindfulness and mindfulness skills can be practiced at any time, anywhere, while doing
anything. Intentionally paying attention to the moment, without judging it or holding on to it, is all
that is needed.
•• Meditation is practicing mindfulness and mindfulness skills while sitting, standing, or lying
quietly for a predetermined period of time. When meditating, we focus the mind (for example,
we focus on body sensations, emotions, thoughts, or our breath), or we open the mind (paying
attention to whatever comes into our awareness). There are many forms of meditation that differ
mostly by whether we are opening the mind or focusing the mind—and, if focusing, depending
on what is the focus of our attention.
•• Contemplative prayer (such as Christian centering prayer, the rosary, Jewish Shema, Islamic
Sufi practice, or Hindu raja yoga) is a spiritual mindfulness practice.
•• Mindfulness movement also has many forms. Examples include yoga, martial arts (such as
Qigong, tai chi, akido, and karate), and spiritual dancing. Hiking, horseback riding, and walking
can also be ways to practice mindfulness.

Ideas for Practicing Wise Mind
The mindfulness skills often require a lot of practice. As with any new skill, it is important to first
practice when you don’t need the skill. If you practice in easier situations, the skill will become
automatic, and you will have the skill when you need it. Practice with your eyes closed and with
your eyes open.
1.  Stone flake on the lake. Imagine that you are by a clear blue lake on a beautiful sunny day.
Then imagine that you are a small flake of stone, flat and light. Imagine that you have been
tossed out onto the lake and are now gently, slowly, floating through the calm, clear blue
water to the lake’s smooth, sandy bottom.
•• Notice what you see, what you feel as you float down, perhaps in slow circles, floating
toward the bottom. As you reach the bottom of the lake, settle your attention there within
yourself.
•• Notice the serenity of the lake; become aware of the calmness and quiet deep within.
•• As you reach the center of your self, settle your attention there.

2. 	
Walking down the spiral stairs. Imagine that within you is a spiral staircase, winding down
to your very center. Starting at the top walk very slowly down the staircase, going deeper
and deeper within yourself.
•• Notice the sensations. Rest by sitting on a step, or turn on lights on the way down if you
wish. Do not force yourself further than you want to go. Notice the quiet. As you reach the
center of your self, settle your attention there—­perhaps in your gut or your abdomen.

3. 	
Breathing “Wise” in, “Mind” out. Breathing in, say to yourself, “Wise”; breathing out, say
“Mind.”
•• Focus your entire attention on the word “wise,” then, focus it again entirely on the word
“mind.”
•• Continue until you sense that you have settled into Wise Mind.

4. 	
Asking Wise Mind a question. Breathing in, silently ask Wise Mind a question.
•• Breathing out, listen for the answer.
•• Listen, but do not give yourself the answer. Do not tell yourself the answer; listen for it.
•• Continue asking on each in-­breath for some time. If no answer comes, try again another
time.

5. 	
Asking is this Wise Mind? Breathing in, ask yourself, “Is this (action, thought, plan, etc.)
Wise Mind?”
•• Breathing out, listen for the answer.
•• Listen, but do not give yourself the answer. Do not tell yourself the answer; listen for it.
•• Continue asking on each in-­breath for some time. If no answer comes, try again another
time.

6. 	
Attending to your breath coming in and out, let your attention settle into your center.
•• Breathing in completely, notice and follow the sensations of your breath coming in.
•• Let your attention settle into your center, at the bottom of your breath, at your solar
plexus—or
•• Let your attention settle in the center of your forehead, your “third eye,” at the top of your
breath.
•• Keeping your attention at your center, exhale, breathing normally, maintaining attention.
•• Settle into Wise Mind.

7. 	
Expanding awareness. Breathing in, focus your awareness on your center.
•• Breathing out, stay aware of your center, but expand awareness to the space you are in
now.
•• Continue on in the moment.

8. 	
Dropping into the pauses between inhaling and exhaling.
•• Breathing in, notice the pause after inhaling (top of breath).
•• Breathing out, notice the pause after exhaling (bottom of breath).
•• At each pause, let yourself “fall into” the center space within the pause.

Taking Hold of Your Mind: “What” Skills
Observe

Notice your body sensations (coming through your eyes, ears, nose, skin, and tongue).

Pay attention on purpose, to the present moment.

Control your attention, but not what you see. Push away nothing. Cling to nothing.

Practice wordless watching: Watch thoughts come into your mind and let them slip right by
like clouds in the sky. Notice each feeling, rising and falling, like waves in the ocean.

Observe both inside and outside yourself.

Describe

Put words on the experience. When a feeling or thought arises, or you do something,
acknowledge it. For example, say in your mind, “Sadness has just enveloped me,” or “Stomach
muscles tightening,“ or “A thought ‘I can’t do this’ has come into my mind.”

Label what you observe. Put a name on your feelings. Label a thought as just a thought, a
feeling as just a feeling, an action as just an action.

Unglue your interpretations and opinions from the facts. Describe the “who, what, when,
and where” that you observe. Just the facts.

Remember, If you can’t observe it through your senses, you can’t describe it.

Participate

Throw yourself completely into activities of the current moment. Do not separate yourself
from what is going on in the moment (dancing, cleaning, talking to a friend, feeling happy or
feeling sad).

Become one with whatever you are doing, completely forgetting yourself. Throw your
attention to the moment.
Act intuitively from Wise Mind. Do just what is needed in each situation—a skillful dancer on

the dance floor, one with the music and your partner, neither willful nor sitting on your hands.

Go with the flow. Respond with spontaneity.

Ideas for Practicing Observing
By Coming Back to Your Senses
Remember: Observing is bringing your mind back to the sensations of your body and mind.
Observe with your eyes:
1. 	
Lie on the ground and watch the clouds in the sky.
2. 	
Walking slowly, stopping somewhere with a view, notice flowers, trees, and nature itself.
3. 	
Sit outside. Watch who and what go by in front of you, without following them with your
head or your eyes.
4. 	
Notice the facial expression and movements of another person. Refrain from labeling the
person’s emotions, thoughts, or interests.
5. 	
Notice just the eyes, lips, or hands of another person (or just one feature of an animal).
6. 	
Pick up a leaf, a flower, or a pebble. Look at it closely, trying to see each detail.
7. 	
Find something beautiful to look at, and spend a few minutes contemplating it.
8. Other:
Observe sounds:
9. 	
Stop for a moment and just listen. Listen to the texture and shape of the sounds around
you. Listen to the silences between the sounds.
10. 	
If someone is talking, listen to the pitch of the voice, to the smoothness or roughness of the
sounds, to the clarity or the mumbling of the speech, to the pauses between the words.
11. 	
Listen to music, observing each note as it comes and the spaces between the notes. Try
breathing the sounds into your body and letting them flow out again on your out breath.
12. Other:
Observe smells around you:
13. 	
Breathing in, notice any smells around you. Bring something close to your nose, and notice
the smells. Take it away, and then notice the smells again. Do they linger?
14. 	
When eating, notice the aroma of the food; when cooking, notice the aroma of the spices or
other ingredients; when bathing, smell the soap or shampoo; when walking outside, notice
the aroma of the air; when near flowers, bend down and “smell the roses.”
15. Other:
Observe taste and the act of eating:
Putting something in your mouth, pay attention to the taste. Keep it in your mouth, and
16. 	
notice all the taste sensations.
Lick a lollipop or something else. Notice just the sensation of taste.
17. 	
18. 	
Eat a meal, or even a part of a meal, paying attention to the taste of each mouthful.
19. Other:
Observe urges to do something:
When you are feeling an urge to do something impulsive,
“Urge-surf” by imagining that your urges are a surfboard and you are standing on the
20. 	
board, riding the waves.
Notice any urge to avoid someone or something.
21. 	
22. 	
Scan your entire body, and notice the sensations. Where in the body is the urge?
23. 	
When you are chewing your food, notice when you have the urge to swallow.

34. 	
The movement of your stomach.
•• As you begin to breathe in, allow your belly to rise in order to bring air into the lower half
of your lungs.
•• As the upper halves of your lungs begin to fill with air, your chest begins to rise.
•• As you breathe out, notice your belly, then notice your chest. Don’t tire yourself.
35. 	
The pauses in your breathing.
•• As you breathe in, notice the brief pause when your lungs have filled with air.
•• As you breathe out, notice the brief pause when you have expelled all the air.
36. 	
The sensations in your nose as you breathe in and as you breathe out.
•• As you breathe, close your mouth and breathe in through your nose, noticing the
sensations traveling up and down your nostrils.
37. 	
Your breath while walking slowly. Breathe normally.
•• Determine the length of your breath—the exhalation and the inhalation—by the number
of your footsteps. Continue for a few minutes.
•• Begin to lengthen your exhalation by one step. Do not force a longer inhalation. Let it be
natural.
•• Watch your inhalation carefully to see whether there is a desire to lengthen it. Now
lengthen the exhalation by one more footstep.
•• Watch to see whether the inhalation also lengthens by one step or not.
•• Only lengthen the inhalation when you feel that it will be comfortable.
•• After 20 breaths, return your breath to normal.
38. 	
Your breath while listening to a piece of music.
•• Breathe long, light, and even breaths.

42. 	
As you notice thoughts in your mind, notice the pauses between each thought.
43. 	
Imagine that your mind is the sky and that thoughts are clouds.
•• Notice each thought-cloud as it drifts by, letting it drift in and out of your mind.
•• Imagine thoughts as leaves on water flowing down a stream, as boats drifting by on the
lake, or as train cars rolling by you.
44. 	
When worries go round and round in your mind, move your attention to the sensations
in your body (those most intense right now). Then, keeping your attention on your body
sensations, notice how long it takes for the worries to ooze away.
45. 	
Step back from your mind, as if you are on top of a mountain and your mind is just a
boulder down below.
•• Gaze at your mind, watching what thoughts come up when you are watching it.
•• Come back into your mind before you stop.
Watch for the first two thoughts that come into your mind.
46. 	
47. Other:
Imagine that your mind is a:
48. 	
Conveyor belt, and that thoughts and feelings are coming down the belt.
•• Put each thought or feeling in a box, and then put it on the conveyor belt and let it go by.
49. 	
Conveyor belt, and that you are sorting thoughts and feelings as they come down the belt.
•• Label the types of thoughts or feelings coming by (e.g., worry thoughts, thoughts about
my past, thoughts about my mother, planning-what-to-do thoughts, angry feeling, sad
feelings).
•• Put them in boxes nearby for another time.
50. 	
River, and that thoughts and feelings are boats going down the river.
•• Imagine sitting on the grass, watching the boats go by.
•• Describe or label each boat as it goes by.
•• Try not to jump on the boat.
51. 	
Railroad track, and that thoughts and feelings are train cars going by.
•• Describe or label each as it goes by. Try not to jump on the train.
52. Other:
Observe by expanding awareness:
53. 	
Breathing in, notice your breath. Then, keeping your breath in your awareness, on the
next breath notice your hands. Then, keeping both in your awareness, on the next breath
expand your awareness to sounds.
•• Continue holding all three in awareness at the same time.
•• Practice this awareness of threes at other times, selecting other things to be aware of.
54. 	
Keeping your focus on what you are currently doing, gently expand your awareness to
include the space around you.
55. 	
Go hug a tree, and feel the sensations of the embrace.

completion.
Focus your mind on paying attention to each sensation that comes into your mind.
59. 

generated by your brain.
•• Notice sensations as they arise, and notice them as they fall away.
•• Let your mind focus on each sensation as it arises.
•• Notice each sensation with curiosity, allowing it to be. Examine the uniqueness of each
sensation.
60. 	
Be here. Be in the present now.
•• Take a moment to notice every sense you are aware of.
•• To yourself, make a statement, about each sense: “I feel the chair; the chair feels me.”
“I hear the heater; the heater hears me.” “I see the wall; the wall sees me.” “I hear a
stomach growl; it hears me.”
61. 	
When a feeling arises within you, notice it—saying, for example, “A feeling of sadness is
arising within me.”
62. 	
When a thought arises within you, notice it—saying, for example, “The thought ‘It is hot in
here’ is arising within me.”
Take just a moment of your time, and practice “nothing-to-do” mind.
63. 	
•• Let yourself become completely aware of your present experience, noticing sensations
and the space around you.
64. 	
Find a small object, one you can hold in your hand. Place it in front of you on a table or in
your lap. Observe it closely—first not moving it, and then picking it up and turning it over
and around, gazing at it from different angles and in different lights. Just notice shapes,
colors, sizes, and other characteristics that are visible.
•• Then change your focus to your fingers and hands touching the object. Notice the
sensations of touching the object; notice the texture, temperature, and feel of the object.
•• Put the object down. Close your eyes, and inhale and exhale deeply and slowly.
•• Then, with beginner’s mind, open your eyes. With new vision, once again notice the
object. With beginner’s mind, open to feeling new textures and sensations, explore the
object with your fingers and hands.

Ideas for Practicing Describing
Practice describing what you see outside of yourself:
1. 	
Lie on the ground and watch the clouds in the sky. Find and describe cloud patterns that
you see.
2. 	
Sit on a bench on a busy street or at a park. Describe one thing about each person who
walks by you.
3. 	
Find things in nature—a leaf, a drop of water, a pet or other animal. Describe each thing in
as much detail as you can.
4. 	
Describe as accurately as you can what a person has just said to you. Check to see if you
are correct.
5. 	
Describe a person’s face when the person seems angry, afraid, or sad. Notice and describe
the shape, movement, and placement of the forehead, eyebrows, and eyes; the lips and
mouth; the cheeks; and so on.
6. 	
Describe what a person has done or is doing now. Be very specific. Avoid describing
intentions or outcomes of the behavior that you do not directly observe. Avoid judgmental
language.
7. Other:
Practice describing thoughts and feelings:
8. 	
Describe your feelings as they arise within you: “A feeling of anger is arising within me.”
9. 	
Describe your thoughts when you feel a strong emotion: “I feel X, and my thoughts are Y.”
10. 	
Describe your feelings after someone else does or says something: “When you do X, I feel
Y.”
11. 	
Describe thoughts, feelings, and what you observed others do: “When you do X, I feel Y,
and my thoughts are Z.” “When X occurs, I feel Y, and my thoughts are Z.”
12. 	
Describe as many of your thoughts as you can while feeling a strong emotion.
13. Other:
Practice describing your breathing:
14. 	
Each time you inhale and exhale, as you inhale, be aware that “I am inhaling, 1.” When you
exhale, be aware that “I am exhaling, 1.” Remember to breathe from the stomach. When
beginning the second inhalation, be aware that “I am inhaling, 2.” And, slowly exhaling, be
aware that “I am exhaling, 2.” Continue on up through 10. After you have reached 10, return
to 1. Whenever you lose count, return to 1.
15. 	
Begin to inhale gently and normally (from the stomach), describing in your mind that “I
am inhaling normally.” Exhale in awareness, “I am exhaling normally.” Continue for three
breaths. On the fourth breath, extend the inhalation, describing in your mind that “I am
breathing in a long inhalation.” Exhale in awareness, “I am breathing out a long exhalation.”
Continue for three breaths.
Follow the entrance and exit of air. Say to yourself, “I am inhaling and following the
16. 	
inhalation from its beginning to its end. I am exhaling and following the exhalation from its
beginning to its end.”

Ideas for Practicing Participating
Participate with awareness of connection to the universe:
1. 	
Focus your attention on where your body touches an object (floor or ground, air molecules,
a chair or armrest, your bed sheets and covers, your clothes, etc.). Try to see all the ways
you are connected to and accepted by that object. Consider the function of that object with
relation to you. That is, consider what the object does for you. Consider its kindness in
doing that. Experience the sensation of touching the object, and focus your entire attention
on that kindness until a sense of being connected or loved or cared for arises in your heart.
Examples: Focus your attention on your feet touching the ground. Consider the kindness of
the ground holding you up, providing a path for you to get to other things, not letting you fall
away from everything else. Focus your attention on your body touching the chair you sit in.
Consider how the chair accepts you totally, holds you up, supports your back, and keeps
you from falling down on the floor. Focus your attention on the sheets and covers on your
bed. Consider the touch of the sheets and covers holding you, surrounding and keeping
you warm and comfortable. Consider the walls in the room. They keep out the wind and the
cold and the rain. Think of how the walls are connected to you via the floor and the air in the
room. Experience your connection to the walls that provide you with a secure place to do
things. Go hug a tree. Think of how you and the tree are connected. Life is in you and in the
tree and both of you are warmed by the sun, held by the air and supported by the earth. Try
and experience the tree loving you by providing something to lean on, or by shading you.
2. 	
Dance to music.
3. 	
Sing along with music you are listening to.
4. 	
Sing in the shower.
5. 	
Sing and dance while watching TV.
6. 	
Jump out of bed and dance, or sing before getting dressed.
7. 	
Go to a church that sings, and join in the singing.
8. 	
Play karaoke with friends or at a karaoke club or bar.
Throw yourself into what another person is saying.
9. 	
10. 	
Go running, focusing only on running.
11. 	
Play a sport and throw yourself into playing.
Become the count of the breath, becoming only “one” when you count 1, becoming only
12. 	
“two” when you count 2, and so on.
13. 	
Become a word as you slowly say the word over and over and over.
14. 	
Take a class in improvisational acting.
15. 	
Take a dance class.

Taking Hold of Your Mind: “How” Skills
Nonjudgmentally

See, but don’t evaluate as good or bad. Just the facts.

Accept each moment like a blanket spread out on the lawn, accepting both the rain and the
sun and each leaf that falls upon it.

Acknowledge the difference between the helpful and the harmful, the safe and the dangerous,
but don’t judge them.

Acknowledge your values, your wishes, your emotional reactions, but don’t judge them.

When you find yourself judging, don’t judge your judging.

One-­Mindfully

Rivet yourself to now. Be completely present to this one moment.

Do one thing at a time. Notice the desire to be half-­present, to be somewhere else, to go
somewhere else in your mind, to do something else, to multitask—and then come back to one
thing at a time.
•• When you are eating, eat.
•• When you are walking, walk.
•• When you are worrying, worry.
•• When you are planning, plan.
•• When you are remembering, remember.
Let go of distractions. If other actions, or other thoughts, or strong feelings distract you, go

back to what you are doing—again, and again, and again.
Concentrate your mind. If you find you are doing two things at once, stop—go back to one

thing at a time (the opposite of multitasking!).

Effectively

Be mindful of your goals in the situation, and do what is necessary to achieve them.

Focus on what works. (Don’t let emotion mind get in the way of being effective.)

Play by the rules.

Act as skillfully as you can. Do what is needed for the situation you are in—not the situation
you wish you were in; not the one that is fair; not the one that is more comfortable.

Let go of willfulness and sitting on your hands.

Ideas for Practicing Nonjudgmentalness
Leaving out comparisons, judgments, and assumptions:
1. 	
Practice observing judgmental thoughts and statements, saying in your mind,
“A judgmental thought arose in my mind.”
2. 	
Count judgmental thoughts and statements (by moving objects or pieces of paper from
one pocket to another, by clicking a sports counter, or by marking a piece of paper).
3. 	
Replace judgmental thoughts and statements with nonjudgmental thoughts and statements.
Tips for replacing judgment by stating the facts:
1. Describe the facts of the event or situation—only what is observed with your senses.
2. Describe the consequences of the event. Keep to the facts.
3. Describe your own feelings in response to the facts (remember, emotions are not
judgments).
4. 	
Observe your judgmental facial expressions, postures, and voice tones (including
voice tones in your head).
5. 	
Change judgmental expressions, postures, and voice tones.
6. 	
Tell someone what you did today nonjudgmentally, or about an event that occurred. Stay
very concrete; only relate what you observed directly.
7. 	
Write out a nonjudgmental description of an event that prompted an emotion.
8. 	
Write out a nonjudgmental blow-by-blow account of a particularly important episode in your
day. Describe both what happened in your environment and what your thoughts, feelings,
and actions were. Leave out any analysis of why something happened, or why you thought,
felt, or acted as you did. Stick to the facts that you observed.
9. 	
Imagine a person you are angry with. Bring to mind what the person has done that has
caused so much anger. Try to become that person, seeing life from that person’s point
of view. Imagine that person’s feelings, thoughts, fears, hopes, and wishes. Imagine that
person’s history and what has happened in his or her history. Imagine understanding that
person.
When judgmental, practice half-­smiling and/or willing hands. (See Distress Tolerance
10. 

Ideas for Practicing One-­Mindfulness
1. 	
Awareness while making tea or coffee. Prepare a pot of tea or coffee to serve a guest or
to drink by yourself. Do each movement slowly, in awareness. Do not let one detail of your
movements go by without being aware of it. Know that your hand lifts the pot by its handle.
Know that you are pouring the fragrant, warm tea or coffee into the cup. Follow each step
in awareness. Breathe gently and more deeply than usual. Take hold of your breath if your
mind strays.
2. 	
Awareness while washing the dishes. Wash the dishes consciously, as though each bowl
is an object of contemplation. Consider each bowl sacred. Follow your breath to prevent your
mind from straying. Do not try to hurry to get the job over with. Consider washing the dishes
the most important thing in life.
3. 	
Awareness while hand-­washing clothes. Do not wash too many clothes at one time.
Select only three or four articles of clothing. Find the most comfortable position to sit or
stand, so as to prevent a backache. Scrub the clothes consciously. Hold your attention on
every movement of your hands and arms. Pay attention to the soap and water. When you
have finished scrubbing and rinsing, your mind and body will feel as clean and fresh as your
clothes. Remember to maintain a half-smile and take hold of your breath whenever your
mind wanders.
4. 	
Awareness while cleaning house. Divide your work into stages: straightening things and
putting away books, scrubbing the toilet, scrubbing the bathroom, sweeping the floors, and
dusting. Allow a good length of time for each task. Move slowly, three times more slowly
than usual. Focus your attention fully on each task. For example, while placing a book on
the shelf, look at the book; be aware of what book it is; know that you are in the process
of placing it on the shelf; and know that you intend to put it in that specific place. Know
that your hand reaches for the book and picks it up. Avoid any abrupt or harsh movement.
Maintain awareness of the breath, especially when your thoughts wander.
5. 	
Awareness while taking a slow-­motion bath. Allow yourself 30–45 minutes to take a
bath. Don’t hurry for even a second. From the moment you prepare the bath water to the
moment you put on clean clothes, let every motion be light and slow. Be attentive of every
movement. Place your attention on every part of your body, without discrimination or fear. Be
aware of each stream of water on your body. By the time you’ve finished, your mind will feel
as peaceful and light as your body. Follow your breath. Think of yourself as being in a clean
and fragrant lotus pond in the summer.
Awareness with meditation. Sit comfortably on the floor with your back straight, on the
6. 	
floor or in a chair with both feet touching the floor. Close your eyes all the way, or open them
slightly and gaze at something near. With each breath, say to yourself, quietly and gently,
the word “One.” As you inhale, say the word “One.” As you exhale, say the word “One,”
calmly and slowly. Try to collect your whole mind and put it into this one word. When your
mind strays, return gently to saying “One.” If you start wanting to move, try not to move. Just
gently observe wanting to move. Continue practicing a little past wanting to stop. Just gently
observe wanting to stop.

Ideas for Practicing Effectiveness
1. 

from the perspective of mysticism
(seven characteristics
of mystical experiences)

Thoughts, attitudes, and actions designed to
help us express or experience connection to:
•• The sacred, the divine within,
the transcendent.
•• God, the Great Spirit, the Absolute,
Elohim, the nameless one, Brahma, Allah,
Parvardigar.
•• Ultimate reality, the totality, the source, our
essential nature, our true self, the core of
our being, the ground of being.
•• No self, emptiness.
Experience where a deeper layer of
reality rises to consciousness. A reality
that has always been there but has been
misperceived. An experience of expansion of
consciousness; the experience of unity and
oneness within the sacred.
1. Direct experience: Experience without
words of ultimate reality.
2. Experience of unity: Awareness of
oneness and of no distance between
oneself, reality, and all other beings.
3. Without words: Experience of reality
that cannot be grasped and can only be
described with metaphors and stories.
4. Certain: During the experience, certainty
of the experience is total, undeniable,
clear.
5. Practical: Experience that is concretely
beneficial to one’s life and well-being.
6. Integrative: Experience that establishes
harmony of love, compassion, mercy,
kindness; quieting of extreme emotions.
7. Sapiential: Experience that leads to
wisdom, enhances capacity for intuitive
knowledge.

Practicing Loving Kindness to Increase
Love and Compassion
What Is Loving Kindness?
Loving kindness is a mindfulness practice designed to increase love and compassion first for ourselves and then for our loved ones, for friends, for those we are
angry with, for difficult people, for enemies, and then for all beings.
Loving kindness can protect us from developing and holding on to judgmentalness,
ill will, and hostile feelings toward ourselves and others.

Practicing Loving Kindness
Practicing loving kindness is like saying a prayer for yourself or someone
else. As when you are asking or praying for something for yourself or others, you
actively send loving and kind wishes, and recite in your mind words and phrases that
express good will toward yourself and others.

Loving Kindness Instructions
1. Choose a person to send loving kindness toward. Do not select a person you
do not want to relate to with kindness and compassion. Start with yourself, or, if
this is too difficult, with a person you already love.
2. Sitting, standing, or lying down, begin by breathing slowly and deeply. Opening
the palms of your hands, gently bring the person to mind.
3. Radiate loving kindness by reciting a set of warm wishes, such as “May I be
happy,” “May I be at peace,” “May I be healthy,” “May I be safe,” or another
set of positive wishes of your own. Repeat the script slowly, and focus on
the meaning of each word as you say it in your mind. (If you have distracting
thoughts, just notice them as they come and go and gently bring your mind
back to your script.) Continue until you feel yourself immersed in loving
kindness.
4. Gradually work yourself up through loved ones, friends, those you are angry
with, difficult people, enemies, and finally all beings. For example, use a script
such as “May John be happy,” “May John be at peace,” and so on (or “John,
may you be happy,” “May you be at peace,” and so on), as you concentrate on
radiating loving kindness to John.
5. Practice each day, starting with yourself and then moving to others.

Doing Mind Is:

Being Mind Is:

• Discriminating Mind

• Curious Mind

• Ambitious Mind

• Nothing-to-Do Mind

• Goal-Oriented
When in doing mind,
you view your thoughts
as facts about the world.
You are focused on
problem solving and
achieving goals.

Wise Mind Is:
• A balance of doing
and being
• The middle path
When in Wise Mind, you:

• Present-Oriented
When in being mind, you
view your thoughts as
sensations of the mind.
You are focused on the
uniqueness of each
moment, letting go of
focusing on goals.

Use skillful means.
Let go of having to achieve
goals—and throw your
entire self into working
toward these same goals.
Enhance awareness while
engaging in activities.
Note. The terms “doing mind,” “being mind,” and “nothing-to-do mind” were first used by Jon Kabat-Zinn in Full Catastrophe Living (1990, 2013).

Ideas for Practicing Balancing
Doing Mind and Being Mind
The mindfulness skills require a lot of practice. The practice ideas below are to help you act
skillfully in everyday life, bringing together doing activities of everyday life with being mind.

Wise Mind reading. To increase your desire for mindfulness, find readings or quotations
1. 	
that have the effect of making you actually want to practice mindfulness in your everyday
life. Put these quotations at strategic spots in your life (e.g., near the coffee maker), and then
while you are waiting for other things, read the inspirational messages.

2. 	
Wise Mind reminders. Set an alarm at home, at work, or (if possible) on your cell phone or
watch to go off randomly or at set times. Use the alarm as a reminder to be mindful of your
current activities. (See www.mindfulnessdc.org/bell/index.html or a similar Internet site for a
free mindfulness clock to download onto your computer.) Set up automatic text messages
or Twitter messages to remind yourself. Write out mindfulness quotations that you like, and
tape them in strategic places where you will see them as reminders to practice mindfulness.

3. 	
Wise Mind in the routine of daily life. Choose one routine activity in your daily life (such
as brushing your teeth, getting dressed, making coffee or tea, working on a task). Make a
deliberate effort to bring moment-to-­moment awareness to that activity.

4. 	
“Just this one moment” Wise Mind. When you begin to feel overwhelmed or frazzled, say,
“Just this one moment, just this one task,” to remind yourself that your only requirement at
the moment is to do one thing in the moment—wash one dish, take one step, move one set
of muscles. In this moment, let the next moment go until you get there.

Mindfulness Handout 9a

(p. 2 of 2)

5. 	
Wise Mind awareness of events. Notice events in your everyday life (both pleasant and
unpleasant), even if they are only very small (such as warm water on your hands when
washing, the taste of something you eat, the feel of wind on your face, the fact that your car
is running out of gas or that you are tired).

6. 	
Wise Mind awareness of what needs to be done. When relaxing after a hard day’s work
or at a break during the day, stay aware of what needs to be done and focus on doing what
is needed.

7. 	
Wise Mind willingness. Practice willingness to do what is needed when you are asked, or
when you see that something needs to be done. Do what is needed with a balance of being
and doing, focusing the mind, immersing yourself in the task.

8. 	
Three-minute WISE MIND: Slowing down “doing mind” in your everyday life
•• Bring yourself into the present moment by adopting a “wide-awake” posture, and then, in
Wise Mind, ask, “What is my experience right now? What thoughts and images are going
through my mind?” Notice them as mental events, as neural firing in your brain. Next ask,
“What are my feelings and sensations in my body?” Notice these as they come into your
awareness. Then say, “OK, this is how it is right now.”
•• Settle into Wise Mind and focus your entire attention on your breath as it goes in and
as it goes out, one breath after another. Gather yourself all together, and focus on the
movements of your chest and abdomen, the rise and fall of your breath, moment by
moment, breath by breath as best you can. Let your breath become an anchor to bring
you into the present moment.
•• Once you have gathered yourself to some extent, allow your awareness to expand. As
well as being aware of the breath, include also a sense of the body as a whole, your
posture, your facial expression, your hands. Follow the breath as if your whole body is
breathing. When you are ready, step back into your activities, acting from Wise Mind of
your whole body in the present moment.

Factors in the Way of Interpersonal Effectiveness

You Don’t Have the Interpersonal Skills You Need

You Don’t Know What You Want

You have the skills, but can’t decide what you really want from the other person.

You can’t figure out how to balance your needs versus the other person’s needs:

Asking for too much versus not asking for anything.

Saying no to everything versus giving in to everything.

Your Emotions Are Getting in the Way

You have the skills, but emotions (anger, pride, contempt, fear, shame, guilt)
control what you do.

You Forget Your Long-Term Goals for Short-Term Goals

You put your immediate urges and wants ahead of your long-term goals. The
future vanishes from your mind.

Other People Are Getting in Your Way

You have the skills but other people get in the way.

Other people are more powerful than you.

Other people may be threatened or may not like you if you get what you want.

Other people may not do what you want unless you sacrifice your self-­respect, at
least a little.

Your Thoughts and Beliefs Are Getting in the Way

Worries about negative consequences if you ask for what you want or say no to
someone’s request get in the way of acting effectively.

Beliefs that you don’t deserve what you want stop you in your tracks.

Beliefs that others don’t deserve what they want make you ineffective.

1. I don’t deserve to get what I want or need.
2. If I make a request, this will show that I am a very weak person.
3. I have to know whether a person is going to say yes before I make a request.
4. If I ask for something or say no, I can’t stand it if someone gets upset with me.
5. If they say no, it will kill me.
6. Making requests is a really pushy (bad, self-­centered, selfish, etc.) thing to do.
7. Saying no to a request is always a selfish thing to do.

Guidelines for Objectives Effectiveness:
Getting What You Want (DEAR MAN)
A way to remember these skills is to remember the term DEAR MAN:

D

Describe
Express
Assert
Reinforce
(Stay) Mindful
Appear Confident
Negotiate
Describe the current situation (if necessary). Stick to the facts.
Tell the person exactly what you are reacting to.
“You told me you would be home by dinner but you didn’t get here until 11.”

E

xpress

Express your feelings and opinions about the situation.
Don’t assume that the other person knows how you feel.
“When you come home so late, I start worrying about you.”

A

ssert

R

einforce

Use phrases such as “I want” instead of “You should,” “I don’t want”
instead of “You shouldn’t.”
Assert yourself by asking for what you want or saying no clearly.
Do not assume that others will figure out what you want.
Remember that others cannot read your mind.
“I would really like it if you would call me when you are going to be late.”
Reinforce (reward) the person ahead of time (so to speak)
by explaining positive effects of getting what you want or need.
If necessary, also clarify the negative consequences of not getting
what you want or need.
“I would be so relieved, and a lot easier to live with, if you do that.”
Remember also to reward desired behavior after the fact.

ignore the threats, comments, or attempts to divert you.
Do not respond to attacks. Ignore distractions.
Just keep making your point.
“I would still like a call.”

“How about if you text me when you think you might be late?”

Turn the tables:

Turn the problem over to the other person.
Ask for other solutions.
“What do you think we should do? . . . I can’t just stop worrying about
you [or I’m not willing to].”

Applying DEAR MAN Skills
to a Difficult Current Interaction
To turn around really difficult situations, focus the skills on the other person’s behavior right now.
When other people have really good skills themselves, and keep refusing your legitimate requests
or pestering you to do something you don’t want to do.
Apply DEAR MAN Skills
1. Describe the current interaction. If the “broken record” and ignoring don’t work, make a
statement about what is happening between you and the person now, but without imputing
motives.
Example: “You keep asking me over and over, even though I have already said no several
times,” or “It is hard to keep asking you to empty the dishwasher when it is your month to do it.”
Not: “You obviously don’t want to hear what I am saying,” “You obviously don’t care about
me,” “Well, it’s obvious that what I have to say doesn’t matter to you,” “Obviously you think I’m
stupid.”
2. Express feelings or opinions about the interaction. For instance, in the middle of an
interaction that is not going well, you can express your feelings of discomfort in the situation.
Example: “I am sorry I cannot do what you want, but I’m finding it hard to keep discussing it,”
or “It’s becoming very uncomfortable for me to keep talking about this, since I can’t help it. I am
starting to feel angry about it,” or “I’m not sure you think this is important for you to do.”
Not: “I hate you!”, “Every time we talk about this, you get defensive,” “Stop patronizing me!”
3. Assert wishes in the situation. When another person is pestering you, you can ask him
or her to stop it. When a person is refusing a request, you can suggest that you put the
conversation off until another time. Give the other person a chance to think about it.
Example: “Please don’t ask me again. My answer won’t change,” or “OK, let’s stop discussing
this now and pick it up again sometime tomorrow,” or “Let’s cool down for a while and then get
together to figure out a solution.”
Not: “Would you shut up?” “You should do this!”, “You should really calm down and do what’s
right here.”
4. Reinforce. When you are saying no to someone who keeps asking, or when someone won’t
take your opinion seriously, suggest ending the conversation, since you aren’t going to change
your mind anyway. When trying to get someone to do something for you, you can suggest that
you will come up with a better offer later.
Example: “Let’s stop talking about this now. I’m not going to change my mind, and I think this is
just going to get frustrating for both of us,” or “OK, I can see you don’t want to do this, so let’s
see if we can come up with something that will make you more willing to do it.”
Not: “If you don’t do this for me, I’ll never do anything for you ever again,” “If you keep asking
me, I’ll get a restraining order against you,” “Gosh, you must be a terrible person for not doing
this/for asking me to do this.”

(Use an) Easy manner
Be nice and respectful.

No attacks:

No verbal or physical attacks. No hitting, clenching fists. No harassment of any

No threats:

If you have to describe painful consequences for not getting what you want,
describe them calmly and without exaggerating.
No “manipulative” statements, no hidden threats. No “I’ll kill myself if you . . . ”
Tolerate a “no.” Stay in the discussion even if it gets painful. Exit gracefully.

No judging:

No moralizing. No “If you were a good person, you would . . . ”
No “You should . . . ” or “You shouldn’t . . . ” Abandon blame.

No sneering: No smirking, eye rolling, sucking teeth. No cutting off or walking away.

away. Don’t interrupt or talk over the person.
Be sensitive to the person’s wish to have the discussion at a later time. Be
patient.
With words and actions, show that you understand the other person’s
feelings and thoughts about the situation. See the world from the other person’s
point of view, and then say or act on what you see.
“I realize this is hard for you, and . . . ”, “I see that you are busy, and . . . ”
Go to a private place when the person is uncomfortable talking in a public
place.

Expanding the V in GIVE: Levels of Validation
1.  Pay Attention:

Look interested in the other person instead of bored (no
multitasking).

2. 	
Reflect Back:

Say back what you heard the other person say or do, to be
sure you understand exactly what the person is saying. No
judgmental language or tone of voice!

3. 	
“Read Minds”:

Be sensitive to what is not being said by the other person.
Pay attention to facial expressions, body language, what is
happening, and what you know about the person already.
Show you understand in words or by your actions. Check it
out and make sure you are right. Let go if you are not.

4. 	
Understand:

Look for how what the other person is feeling, thinking, or
doing makes sense, based on the person’s past experiences,
present situation, and/or current state of mind or physical
condition (i.e., the causes).

5. 	
Acknowledge the Valid:

Look for how the person’s feelings, thinking, or actions
are valid responses because they fit current facts, or are
understandable because they are a logical response to
current facts.

6. 	
Show Equality:

Be yourself! Don’t “one-up” or “one-down” the other person.
Treat the other as an equal, not as fragile or incompetent.

(p. 2 of 3)

Factors to Consider
When deciding how firm or intense
you want to be in asking or saying no, think about:
1. The other person’s or your own capability.
2. Your priorities.
3. The effect of your actions on your self-­respect.
4. Your or the other’s moral and legal rights in the situation.
5. Your authority over the person (or his or hers over you).
6. The type of relationship you have with the person.
7. The effect of your action on long- versus short-term goals.
8. The degree of give and take in your relationship.
9. Whether you have done your homework to prepare.
10. The timing of your request or refusal.

1. Capability:

•• Is the person able to give you what you want? If yes, raise the intensity of asking.
•• Do you have what the person wants? If no, raise the intensity of no.

2. Priorities:

•• Are your goals very important? Increase intensity.
•• Is your relationship shaky? Consider reducing intensity.
•• Is your self-­respect on the line? Intensity should fit your values.

3. Self-­respect:

•• Do you usually do things for yourself? Are you careful to avoid acting helpless when
you are not? If yes, raise the intensity of asking.
•• Will saying no make you feel bad about yourself, even when you are thinking about
it wisely? If no, raise the intensity of no.

4. Rights:

•• Is the person required by law or moral code to give you what you want? If yes,
raise the intensity of asking.
•• Are you required to give the person what he or she is asking for? Would saying no
violate the other person’s rights? If no, raise the intensity of no.

5. Authority:

•• Are you responsible for directing the person or telling the person what to do? If
yes, raise the intensity of asking.
•• Does the person have authority over you (e.g., your boss, your teacher)? And is
what the person is asking within his or her authority? If no, raise the intensity of
no.
(continued on next page)

Interpersonal Effectiveness Handout 8
6. Relationship:

(p. 3 of 3)

•• Is what you want appropriate to the current relationship? If yes, raise the intensity
of asking.
•• Is what the person is asking for appropriate to your current relationship? If no, raise
the intensity of no.

Long-term
versus
short-term
goals:

•• Will not asking for what you want keep the peace now but create problems in the
long run? If yes, raise the intensity of asking.

8. GIve and take:

•• What have you done for the person? Are you giving at least as much as you ask
for? Are you willing to give if the person says yes? If yes, raise the intensity of
asking.

7.

•• Is giving in to keep the peace right now more important than the long-term welfare
of the relationship? Will you eventually regret or resent saying no? If no, raise the
intensity of no.

•• Do you owe this person a favor? Does he or she do a lot for you? If no, raise the
intensity of no.
9. Homework:

•• Have you done your homework? Do you know all the facts you need to know
to support your request? Are you clear about what you want? If yes, raise the
intensity of asking.
•• Is the other person’s request clear? Do you know what you are agreeing to? If no,
raise the intensity of no.

10. Timing:

•• Is this a good time to ask? Is the person “in the mood” for listening and paying
attention to you? Are you catching the person when he or she is likely to say yes to
your request? If yes, raise the intensity of asking.
•• Is this a bad time to say no? Should you hold off answering for a while? If no, raise
the intensity of no.

Troubleshooting:
When What You Are Doing Isn’t Working

1

Do I have the skills I need? Check out the instructions.
Review what has already been tried.
•• Do I know how to be skillful in getting what I want?
•• Do I know how to say what I want to say?
•• Do I follow the skill instructions to the letter?

Do I know what I really want in this interaction?
Ask:

2

•• Am I undecided about what I really want in this interaction?
•• Am I unsure of my priorities?
•• Am I having trouble balancing:
•• Asking for too much versus too little?
•• Saying no to everything versus saying yes to everything?
•• Is fear or shame getting in the way of knowing what I really want?

3

Are short-term goals getting in the way of long-term goals?
Ask:
•• Is “now, now, now” winning out over getting what I really want in the
future?
•• Is emotion mind controlling what I say and do instead of Wise Mind?

Are my emotions getting in the way of using my skills?
Ask:
•• Do I get too upset to use my skills?
•• Are my emotions so high that I am over my skills breakdown point?

Are worries, assumptions, and myths getting in my way?
Ask:

5

•• Are thoughts about bad consequences blocking my action?
“They won’t like me,” “She will think I am stupid.”
•• Are thoughts about not deserving things getting in my way?
“I am such a bad person I don’t deserve this.”
•• Am I calling myself names that stop me from doing anything?
“I won’t do it right,” “I’ll probably fall apart,” “I’m so stupid.”
•• Do I believe myths about interpersonal effectiveness?
“If I make a request, this will show that I am a weak person,”
“Only wimps have values.”

Is the environment more powerful than my skills?

6

Ask:
•• Are the people who have what I want or need more powerful than I am?
•• Are other people more in control of the situation than I am?
•• Will others be threatened if I get what I want?
•• Do others have reasons for not liking me if I get what I want?

Finding and Getting People to Like You
Remember: All Human Beings Are Lovable.
But finding friends may take effort on your part.

Look for People Who Are Close by You.
Familiarity often leads to liking and sometimes love.
To find people you might like and who might like you, it is important to make sure that you
are frequently around and visible to a group of people. Many people find friends who are
classmates or members of groups they join, or who work at or go to the same places.

Look for People Who Are Similar to You.
We often make friends with people who share our interests and attitudes.
Though always agreeing with someone will not make you more attractive to them, a lot of
people are attracted to those who share the same important interests and attitudes, such as
politics, lifestyle, morals.

Work on Your Conversation Skills.
Ask and respond to questions; respond with a little more info than requested.
Make small talk; don’t underestimate the value of chit-chat.
Self-­disclose skillfully; keep your self-­disclosure close to that of the other person.
Don’t interrupt; don’t start talking just fractionally before or after someone else.
Learn things to talk about: Watch others; read; increase your activities and experiences.

Express Liking (Selectively).
We often like the people we think like us.
Express genuine liking for the other person. But don’t try to suck up to the other person or
grovel. Find things to compliment that are not super-­obvious. Don’t praise too much too often,
and never use compliments to obtain favors.

(p. 2 of 2)

Join an Ongoing Group Conversation.
If we wait for people to approach us, we may never have friends.
Sometimes we must make the first move in finding friends. This often requires us to know how
to tell if a group is open or closed, and then, when it is open, how to approach and join in the
ongoing group.

Figure Out If a Group Is Open or Closed.
In open groups new members are welcome.
In closed groups new members may not be welcome.
Open Groups

Closed Groups

•• Everyone is standing somewhat apart.
•• Members occasionally glance around the
room.
•• There are gaps in the conversation.
•• Members are talking about a topic of
general interest.

•• Everyone is standing close together.
•• Members attend exclusively to each other.
•• There is a very animated conversation with
few gaps.
•• Members seem to be pairing off.

Figure Out How to Join an Open Group Conversation.
Ways of Joining an Open Group

Potential Outcomes

Move gradually closer to the group.

It may not be clear from the slowness of your
approach that you want to join them; it might even
look as though you were creeping up and trying to
eavesdrop!

Offer to refill members’ glasses/
serve them food.

That could be overdoing things a bit. What would you
do if they refused more food/drinks? Would it be clear
enough that you wanted to join the group?

Stand beside them and chip in on
their conversation.

That might seem rude. They haven’t invited you to
join them, and anyway, what exactly are you going to
say when you chip in?

Go up and introduce yourself.

Isn’t that overly formal? Having introduced yourself,
then what do you say? Will they introduce themselves
to you? Wouldn’t you interrupt the conversation?

Wait for a break in the
conversation, stand beside a
friendly-­looking member of the
group and say something like
“Mind if I join you?”

This makes your intention clear and doesn’t
seem rude or interrupt the conversation; group
members can then choose whether to introduce
themselves or not.

Mindfulness of Others
Friendships last longer when we are mindful.

Observe


Give up clinging to always being right.

Describe


Avoid assuming or interpreting what other people think about you
without checking the facts. (Remember, no one has ever observed
another person’s thoughts, motives, intentions, feelings, emotions,
desires, or experiences.)

good reasons to do so).

Give others the benefit of the doubt.

Ending Relationships
A destructive relationship has the quality of destroying or completely spoiling either the quality
of the relationship or aspects of yourself—such as your physical body and safety, your self-­esteem
or sense of integrity, your happiness or peace of mind, or your caring for the other person.
An interfering relationship is one that blocks or makes difficult your pursuing goals that are important to you; your ability to enjoy life and do things you like doing; your relationships with other persons; or the welfare of others that you love.

Decide to end relationships in Wise Mind,
never in emotion mind.

If the relationship is important and not destructive,
and there is reason to hope it can be improved, try
problem solving to repair a difficult relationship.

cope ahead to troubleshoot
and practice ending the relationship ahead of time.

Be direct: Use the DEAR MAN GIVE FAST interpersonal
effectiveness skills.

Practice opposite action for love when you find
you love the wrong person.

Practice safety first!
Before leaving a highly abusive or life-­threatening
relationship, call a local domestic violence hotline or the
toll-free National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233)
for help with safety planning and a referral to a qualified
professional. See also the International Directory of Domestic
Violence Agencies (www.hotpeachpages.net).

Overview:
Walking the Middle Path
Balancing Acceptance and Change

Dialectics
Balancing opposites while entering the paradox of “yes”
and “no,” “true” and “not true,” at the very same time.

Validation
Including the valid and understanable in ourselves and others.

Recovering from Invalidation
From a nondefensive position, find the valid, acknowledge
the invalid, and radically accept yourself.

Strategies for Changing Behavior
Use behavioral principles to increase desired behaviors and
decrease undesired behaviors.

Dialectics
Dialectics reminds us that
1. The universe is filled with opposing sides/opposing forces.
There is always more than one way to see a situation, and more than one way to solve a
problem.
Two things that seem like opposites can both be true.

2.	Everything and every person is connected in some way.
The waves and the ocean are one.
The slightest move of the butterfly affects the furthest star.

3.	Change is the only constant.
Meaning and truth evolve over time.
Each moment is new; reality itself changes with each moment.

4.	Change is transactional.
What we do influences our environment and other people in it.
The environment and other people influence us.

How to Think and Act Dialectically

1. There is always more than one side to anything that exists. Look for both sides.

Ask Wise Mind: What am I missing? Where is the kernel of truth in the other side?

Let go of extremes: Change “either-or” to “both-and,” “always” or “never” to
“sometimes.”

Balance opposites: Validate both sides when you disagree, accept reality, and work to
change.

Make lemonade out of lemons.

Embrace confusion: Enter the paradox of yes and no, or true and not true.

Play devil’s advocate: Argue each side of your own position with equal passion.

Use metaphors and storytelling to unstick and free the mind.

Other ways to see all sides of a situation:

2. Be aware that you are connected.

Treat others as you want them to treat you.

Look for similarities among people instead of differences.

Notice the physical connections among all things.

Other ways to stay aware of connections:

3.	Embrace change.

Throw yourself into change: Allow it. Embrace it.

Practice radical acceptance of change when rules, circumstances, people, and
relationships change in ways you don’t like.

Practice getting used to change: Make small changes to practice this (e.g., purposely
change where you sit, who you talk with, what route you take when going to a familiar
place).

Other ways to embrace change:

4.	Change is transactional: Remember that you affect your environment and your
environment affects you.

Pay attention to your effect on others and how they affect you.

Practice letting go of blame by looking for how your own and others’ behaviors are
caused by many interactions over time.
Remind yourself that all things, including all behaviors, are caused.


Other ways to see transactions:

Validation
Validation Means:
•• Finding the kernel of truth in another person’s perspective or situation; verifying the facts of
a situation.
•• Acknowledging that a person’s emotions, thoughts, and behaviors have causes and are
therefore understandable.
•• Not necessarily agreeing with the other person.
•• Not validating what is actually invalid.

Why Validate?
•• It improves our relationships by showing we are listening and understand.
•• It improves interpersonal effectiveness by reducing:
1. Pressure to prove who is right
2. Negative reactivity
3. Anger
•• It makes problem solving, closeness, and support possible.
•• Invalidation hurts.

Important Things to Validate
•• The valid (and only the valid).
•• The facts of a situation.
•• A person’s experiences, feelings/emotions, beliefs, opinions, or thoughts about something.
•• Suffering and difficulties.

Remember:
•• Every invalid response makes sense in some way.
•• Validation is not necessarily agreeing.
•• Validation doesn’t mean you like it.
•• Only validate the valid!

A “How To” Guide to Validation
1. 	Pay Attention:
Look interested, listen, and observe. No multitasking. Make eye contact. Stay focused. Nod
occasionally. Respond with your face (e.g., smile at happy statements; look concerned when
hearing something painful).
2. 	Reflect Back:
Say back what you heard or observed to be sure you actually understand what the person is
saying. No judgmental language or voice tone!
		 Try to really “get” what the person feels or thinks. Have an open mind. (No disagreeing,
criticizing, or trying to change the person’s mind or goals.) Use a voice tone that allows the
other person to correct you . . . and check the facts!
		Example: “So you are mad at me because you think I lied just to get back at you. Did I get it
right?”
3. 	“Read Minds”:
Be sensitive to what is not being said by the other person. Pay attention to facial
expressions, body language, what is happening, and what you know about the person
already. Show that you understand in words or by your actions. Be open to correction.
		Example: When you are asking a friend for a ride at the end of a long day and the person
slumps down, say, “You look really tired. Let me look for someone else.”
4. 	Understand:
Look for how the other person feels, is thinking, or if he or she is making sense, given the
person’s history, state of mind or body, or current events (i.e. the causes)—even if you don’t
approve of the person’s behavior, or if his or her belief is incorrect. Say “It makes sense that
you . . . because . . . ”
		Example: If you sent a party invitation to the wrong address, say, “I can see why you thought
I might be excluding you on purpose.”
5. 	Acknowledge the valid:
Show that you see that the person’s thoughts, feelings, or actions are valid, given current
reality and facts. Act as if the person’s behavior is valid.
		Example: If you are criticized for not taking out the garbage on your day, admit that it is your
day and take it out. If people present a problem, help them solve it (unless they just want to
be heard). If people are hungry, give them food. Acknowledge the effort a person is making.
6. 	Show Equality:
Be yourself! Don’t “one-up” or “one-down” the other person. Treat the other as an equal, not
as fragile or incompetent.
		Example: Be willing to admit mistakes. If someone introduces him- or herself by first name,
introduce yourself by your first name. Ask other people for their opinions. Give up being
defensive. Be careful in giving advice or telling someone what to do if you are not asked or
required to do so. Even then, remember you could be wrong.

Recovering from Invalidation
Notice That Invalidation
Can Be Helpful and Painful at the Same Time

Remember:
Invalidation Is Helpful When
1. It corrects important mistakes (your facts are wrong).
2. It stimulates intellectual and personal growth by listening
to other views.
3. Other:                       

Invalidation Is Painful When
1. You are being ignored.
2. You are not being repeatedly misunderstood.
3. You are being misread.
4. You are being misinterpreted.
5. Important facts in your life are ignored or denied.
6. You are receiving unequal treatment.
7. You are being disbelieved when being truthful.
8. Your private experiences are trivialized or denied.

Remind yourself that all behavior is caused and that you are doing
your best.

Strategies for Increasing the Probability
of Behaviors You Want
Describe behaviors for yourself or others that you would like to start or increase:

Reinforcer = A consequence that increases frequency of a behavior.
Positive reinforcement = positive consequences (i.e., reward).
Behavior is increased by consequences a person wants, likes, or will work to get.
Examples:                                         
Negative reinforcement = removal of negative events (i.e., relief).
Behavior is increased by consequences that stop or reduce something negative.
Examples:                                         

Shaping = Reinforcing small steps toward the behavior you want.
•• Reinforce small steps that lead toward the goal.
•• As new behavior stabilizes, require a little bit more before reinforcing.
•• Continue until you reach the goal behavior.
Examples of steps to a goal behavior:                            
                                             

Timing counts.
•• Reinforce behavior immediately after it occurs.
•• When shaping new behavior, at first reinforce every instance of the behavior.
•• Once behavior is established, gradually start to reinforce only some of the time.
CAUTION: When you vary reinforcement, behavior becomes very hard to stop.

Strategies for Decreasing or Stopping
Unwanted Behaviors
Extinction = Stopping an ongoing reinforcement of behavior.
Extinction leads first to a burst of behavior, and then to a decrease in behavior.
Examples:                                         
Satiation = Providing relief or what is wanted before the behavior occurs.
Satiation reduces motivation for behavior and thus decreases its frequency.
Examples:                                         

Punishment = An aversive consequence that decreases a behavior.
Behavior is decreased by consequences the person dislikes or will work to avoid.
Examples:                                         
Behavior is decreased by consequences that stop or reduce something positive.
Examples:                                         
Behavior is decreased when something the person wants is withheld until harmful effects of
problem behaviors are corrected and overcorrected.
Examples:                                         
•• Be sure that punishment is specific, is time-­limited, and fits the “crime.”
•• Avoid a punitive tone; let the consequence do the work.
•• If a natural punishment occurs, don’t undo it. Don’t add arbitrary punishment.

Be sure to reinforce alternative behavior to replace behavior you want stopped.
•• Extinction and punishment weaken or suppress behavior, but do not eliminate it.
•• Extinction and punishment do not teach new behavior.
•• To keep a behavior from resurfacing, reinforce an alternative behavior.
•• Punishment works only when the punisher is (or is likely to be) present.
•• Punishment leads to avoidance of the person punishing.

Tips for Using Behavior Change Strategies Effectively
Summary so far:
Goal
Increase behavior

Consequence
(Reinforce)

•• Add positive consequence
•• Remove aversive consequence

Weaken behavior

(Extinguish)

•• Remove reinforcer
•• Provide relief before unwanted behavior

Suppress
behavior

(Punish)

•• Add aversive consequence
•• Remove positive consequence

Not all consequences are created equal.
“One person’s poison can be another person’s passion.”
Context counts. A reinforcer in one situation can be punishment in another.
Quantity counts. If a reinforcer is too little or too much, it will not work.
Natural consequences work best. Let them do the work when possible.
Ask what consequence the person would work to get (reinforcer) or work to avoid
(punisher).
Observe changes in behavior when a consequence is applied.

Behavior learned in one situation may not happen in another situation.

•
find one that fits the severity of the

•
problem behavior.


• 
6A. When you are punishing, figure that
•
a nonspecific punishment will be a
•
•
lot more effective, since it can’t be

• 
3A. It is most effective to reinforce

behavior immediately after it occurs.
•
•

after a delay so that the person

• 
7A. If a person’s mean behavior makes

Overview:
Understanding and Naming Emotions

What Emotions Do for You
There are reasons why we have emotions.
We need them!

Factors That Make
Regulating Emotions Hard
Lack of skills, reinforcing consequences, moodiness, rumination/
worrying, myths about emotions, and biology can interfere
with changing emotions.

A Model for Describing Emotions
Emotions are complex responses.
Changing any part of the system can change the entire response.

Ways to Describe Emotions
Learning to observe, describe, and name your emotion
can help you regulate your emotions.

What Emotions Do for You
Emotions Motivate (and Organize) Us for Action
•• Emotions motivate our behavior. Emotions prepare us for action.
The action urge of specific emotions is often “hard-wired” in biology.
•• Emotions save time in getting us to act in important situations.
Emotions can be especially important when we don’t have time to think things through.
•• Strong emotions help us overcome obstacles—in our minds and in the environment.

Emotions Communicate to (and Influence) Others
•• Facial expressions are hard-wired aspects of emotions.
Facial expressions communicate faster than words.
•• Our body language and voice tone can also be hard-wired.
Like it or not, they also communicate our emotions to others.
•• When it is important to communicate to others, or send them a message,
it can be very hard to change our emotions.
•• Whether we intend it or not, our communication of emotions influences others.

Emotions Communicate to Ourselves
•• Emotional reactions can give us important information about a situation.
Emotions can be signals or alarms that something is happening.
•• Gut feelings can be like intuition—a response to something important about the situation.
This can be helpful if our emotions get us to check out the facts.
•• Caution: Sometimes we treat emotions as if they are facts about the world: The stronger
the emotion, the stronger our belief that the emotion is based on fact. (Examples: “If I feel
unsure, I am incompetent,” “If I get lonely when left alone, I shouldn’t be left alone,” “If I feel
confident about something, it is right,” “If I’m afraid, there must be danger,” “I love him, so
he must be OK.”)
•• If we assume that our emotions represent facts about the world, we may use them to justify
our thoughts or our actions. This can be trouble if our emotions get us to ignore the facts.

What Makes It Hard to Regulate Your Emotions
Biology

Biological factors can make emotion regulation harder.

Lack of Skill

You don’t know what to do to regulate your emotions.

Reinforcement of Emotional Behavior

Your environment reinforces you when you are highly emotional.

Moodiness

Your current mood controls what you do instead of your Wise Mind.

You don’t really want to put in time and effort to regulate your emotions.

Emotional Overload

High emotional arousal causes you to reach a skills breakdown point.
You can’t follow skills instructions or figure out what to do.

Emotion Myths

Myths (e.g., mistaken beliefs) about emotions get in the way of your
ability to regulate emotions.

Myths that emotions are bad or weak lead to avoiding emotions.

Myths that extreme emotions are necessary or are part of who you are
keep you from trying to regulate your emotions.

Overview:
Changing Emotional Responses

Check the Facts
Check out whether your emotional reactions fit the facts
of the situation.
Changing your beliefs and assumptions to fit the facts can help
you change your emotional reactions to situations.

Opposite Action
When your emotions do not fit the facts,
or when acting on your emotions is not effective,
acting opposite (all the way)
will change your emotional reactions.

Problem Solving
When the facts themselves are the problem,
solving the problem
will reduce the frequency of negative emotions.

Check the Facts
Facts
Many emotions and actions are set off by our thoughts and interpretations of events,
not by the events themselves.
Event → Thoughts → Emotions
Our emotions can also have a big effect on our thoughts about events.
Event → Emotion → Thoughts
Examining our thoughts and checking the facts can help us change our emotions.

How to Check the Facts
1.	Ask: What is the emotion I want to change?
(See Emotion Regulation Handout 6: Ways of Describing Emotions.)

2.	Ask: What is the event prompting my emotion?
Describe the facts that you observed through your senses.
Challenge judgments, absolutes, and black-and-white descriptions.
(See Mindfulness Handout 4: Taking Hold of Your Mind: “What” Skills.)

3.	Ask: What are my interpretations, thoughts, and assumptions about the
event?
Think of other possible interpretations.
Practice looking at all sides of a situation and all points of view.
Test your interpretations and assumptions to see if they fit the facts.
4.	Ask: Am I assuming a threat?
Label the threat.
Assess the probability that the threatening event will really occur.
Think of as many other possible outcomes as you can.
5.	Ask: What’s the catastrophe?
Imagine the catastrophe really occurring.
Imagine coping well with a catastrophe (through problem solving, coping
ahead, or radical acceptance).
6.	Ask: Does my emotion and/or its intensity fit the actual facts?
Check out facts that fit each emotion.
Ask Wise Mind.

Opposite Action
Use opposite action when your emotions do not fit the facts
or when acting on your emotions is not effective.

Every emotion has an action urge.
Change the emotion by acting opposite to its action urge.
Consider these examples:
Emotion

Opposite action

Fear

Run away/avoid

Approach/don’t avoid

Anger

Attack

Gently avoid/be a little nice

Sadness

Withdraw/isolate

Get active

Shame

Hide/avoid

Tell the secret to people who will accept it

How to Do Opposite Action, Step by Step
Step 1. Identify and name the emotion you want to change.
Step 2. Check the facts to see if your emotion is justified by the facts.
Check also whether the intensity and duration of the emotion fit the facts.
(Example: “Irritation” fits the facts when your car is cut in front of; “road rage” does not.)
An emotion is justified when your emotion fits the facts.
Step 3. Identify and describe your action urges.
Step 4. Ask Wise Mind: Is expression or acting on this emotion effective in this situation?

If your emotion does not fit the facts or if acting on your emotion is not effective:
Step 5. Identify opposite actions to your action urges.
Step 6. Act opposite all the way to your action urges.
Step 7. Repeat acting opposite to your action urges until your emotion changes.

This will be your target nightmare. Select a nightmare you can manage now.
Put off trauma nightmares until you are ready to work with them—or, if you
target a trauma nightmare, skip Step 3.
3. Write down your target nightmare.
Include sensory descriptions (sights, smells, sounds, tastes, etc.). Also
include any thoughts, feelings, and assumptions about yourself during the
dream.
4.	Choose a changed outcome for the nightmare.
The change should occur before anything traumatic or bad happens to you
or others in the nightmare. Essentially, you want to come up with a change
that will prevent the bad outcome of the usual nightmare from occurring. Write
an ending that will give you a sense of peace when you wake up.
Note: Changes in the nightmare can be very unusual and out of the ordinary
(e.g., you might become a person with superhuman powers who is able
to escape to safety or fight off attackers). Changed outcomes can include
changed thoughts, feelings, or assumptions about yourself.
5. Write down the full nightmare with the changes.
6. Rehearse and relax each night before going to sleep.
Rehearse the changed nightmare by visualizing the entire dream with the
changes each night, before practicing relaxation techniques.
7. Rehearse and relax during the day.
Visualize the entire dream with the change, and practice relaxation as often
as possible during the day.

Sleep Hygiene Protocol
When You Can’t Sleep, What to Do Instead of Ruminating
To Increase the Likelihood of Restfulness/Sleep:
1. Develop and follow a consistent sleep schedule even on weekends. Go to bed and get up
at the same times each day, and avoid anything longer than a 10-minute nap during the day.
2. Do not use your bed in the daytime for things like watching TV, talking on the phone, or
reading.
3.	Avoid caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, heavy meals, and exercise late in the day before going to
sleep.
4. When prepared to sleep, turn off the light, and keep the room quiet and the
temperature comfortable and relatively cool. Try an electric blanket if you are cold; putting
your feet outside of the blanket or turning on a fan directed toward your bed if you are hot; or
wearing a sleeping mask, using earplugs, or turning on a “white noise” machine if needed.
5. Give yourself half an hour to at most an hour to fall asleep. If it doesn’t work, evaluate
whether you are calm, or anxious (even if only “background anxiety”), or ruminating.
6. Do not catastrophize. Remind yourself that you need rest, and aim for reverie (i.e.,
dreaminess) and resting your brain. Sell yourself on the idea that staying awake is not a
catastrophe. Do not decide to give up on sleeping for the night and get up for the “day.”
If You Are Calm but Wide Awake:
7. Get out of bed; go to another room and read a book or do some other activity that will not
wake you up further. As you begin to get tired and/or sleepy, go back to bed.
8. Try a light snack (e.g., an apple).
If You Are Anxious or Ruminating
9.	Use the cold water TIP skill. Get right back in bed and do the paced breathing TIP skill.
(See Distress Tolerance Handout 6: TIP Skills: Changing Your Body Chemistry.)

Remember, if you have any medical condition, get medical approval before using cold water.
10. Try the 9–0 meditation practice. Breathe in deeply and breathe out slowly, saying in your
mind the number 9. On the next breath out, say 8; then say 7; and so on until you breathe out
saying 0. Then start over, but this time start with 8 (instead of 9) as you breathe out, followed
by 7, and so on until you reach 0. Next start with 6 as you breathe out, and so on to 0. Then
start with 5, then with 4, and so on until you have gone all the way down to starting with 1. (If
you get lost, start over with the last number you remember.) Continue until you fall asleep.
11.	Focus on the bodily sensation of the rumination (rumination is often escape from difficult
emotional sensations).
12.	Reassure yourself that worries in the middle of the night are just “middle-of-the-night-­
thinking,” and that in the morning you will think and feel differently.
13.	Read an emotionally engrossing novel for a few minutes until you feel somewhat tired. Then
stop reading, close your eyes, and try to continue the novel in your head.
14.	If rumination doesn’t stop, follow these guidelines: “If it’s solvable, solve it. If it is insolvable,
go deep into the worry all the way to the “catastrophe”—the very worst outcome you can
imagine—and then imagine coping ahead with the catastrophe.
(See Emotion Regulation Handout 19: Build Mastery and Cope Ahead.)

If nothing else works, with eyes closed, listen to public radio (BBC, NPR, etc.) at low volume
(use headphones if necessary). Public radio is a good choice for this, because there is little fluctuation in voice tone or volume.

Overview:
Managing Really Difficult Emotions
Mindfulness of Current Emotions
Suppressing emotion increases suffering.
Mindfulness of current emotions is the path to emotional freedom.

Managing Extreme Emotions
Sometimes emotional arousal is so high that you can’t use any skills,
particularly if the skills are complicated or take any thought on your part.
This is a skills breakdown point.
Crisis survival skills are needed.

Troubleshooting and Review
There are many ways to change emotions.
It can be helpful to have a list of the important skills
to look at when you can’t remember the skills you need to regulate
your emotions.

Mindfulness of Current Emotions:
Letting Go of Emotional Suffering
Observe Your Emotion
•• Step back and just notice your emotion.
•• Experience your emotion as a wave, coming and going.
•• Now imagine surfing the emotion wave.
•• Try not to block or suppress the emotion.
•• Don’t try to get rid of or push away the emotion.
•• Don’t try to keep the emotion around.
•• Don’t hold on to it.
•• Don’t amplify it.

Practice Mindfulness of Body Sensations
•• Notice where in your body you are feeling emotional sensations.
•• Experience the sensations as fully as you can.
•• Observe how long it takes before the emotion goes down.

Remember: You Are Not Your Emotion
•• Do not necessarily act on your emotion.
•• Remember times when you have felt different.

Practice Loving Your Emotion
•• Respect your emotion.
•• Do not judge your emotion.
•• Practice willingness.
•• Radically accept your emotion.

Emotion Regulation Handout 23
Managing Extreme Emotions
Follow these suggestions when emotional arousal is very HIGH—so extreme that your ability to
use your skills breaks down.
First, observe and describe that you are at your skills breakdown point:

Your distress is extreme.

You are overwhelmed.

You cannot focus your mind on anything but the emotion itself.

Your mind shuts down; your brain stops processing information.

You cannot solve problems or use complicated skills.
Now check the facts. Are you really “falling apart” at this level of distress?
If no, use your skills.
If yes, go to Step 1: You are at your skills breakdown point.

Step 1. Use crisis survival skills to bring down your arousal:
(See Distress Tolerance Handouts 6–9a.)

•• TIP your body chemistry.
•• Distract yourself from the emotional events.
•• Self-­soothe through the five senses.
•• Improve the moment you are in.
Step 2. Return to mindfulness of current emotions.
(See Emotion Regulation Handout 22.)

Step 3. Try other emotion regulation skills (if needed).

Troubleshooting Emotion Regulation Skills: When What
You Are Doing Isn’t Working
Check Your Biological Sensitivity

1

•• Ask: Am I biologically more vulnerable?
Do I have untreated physical illness or distress?
Am I out of balance on eating, use of drugs, sleep, exercise?
Have I taken medications as prescribed?
•• Work on your PLEASE skills.
1. Take care of physical illness and distress.
2. Take medications as prescribed. Check if others are needed.
3. Try again.

Check Your Skills

2

•• Review what you have tried.
Did you try a skill likely to be effective?
Did you follow the skill instructions to the letter?
•• Work on your skills.
1. Review and try other skills.
2. Get coaching if you need it.
3. Try again.

Check for Reinforcers

3

•• Ask: Do my emotions . . .
Communicate an important message or influence people to do things?
Motivate me to do things I think are important?
Validate my beliefs or my identity?
Feel good?
•• If yes:
1. Practice interpersonal effectiveness skills to communicate.
2. Work to find new reinforcers to motivate yourself.
3. Practice self-­validation.
4. Do pros and cons for changing emotions.

Check Your Mood

4

•• Ask: Am I putting in the time and effort that solving my problem will take?
•• If no:
1. Do pros and cons for working hard on skills.
2. Practice radical acceptance and willingness skills.
3. Practice the mindfulness skills of participating and effectiveness
(See Mindfulness Handouts 4 and 5.)

Check for Emotional Overload
•• Ask: Am I too upset to use complicated skills?

5

•• If yes, ask: Can the problems I am worrying about be easily solved now?
•• If yes, do problem solving.
(See Emotion Regulation Handouts 9, 12.)

•• If no, practice mindfulness of current emotions.
(See Emotion Regulation Handout 22.)

•• If your emotions are too high for you to think straight:
•• Go to TIP skills.
(See Distress Tolerance Handout 5.)

Check for Emotion Myths Getting in the Way

6

•• Check for:
Judgmental myths about emotions (e.g., “Some emotions are stupid,” “There is a
right way to feel in every situation”)?
Beliefs that emotions and identity are the same (e.g., “My emotions are who I
am”)?
•• If yes:
1. Check the facts.
2. Challenge myths.
3. Practice thinking nonjudgmentally.

When to Use Crisis Survival Skills
You are in a crisis when the situation is:
•• Highly stressful.
•• Short-term (that is, it won’t last a long time).
•• Creates intense pressure to resolve the crisis now.

Use crisis survival skills when:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

You have intense pain that cannot be helped quickly.
You want to act on your emotions, but it will only make things worse.
Emotion mind threatens to overwhelm you, and you need to stay skillful.
You are overwhelmed, yet demands must be met.
Arousal is extreme, but problems can’t be solved immediately.

Don’t use crisis survival skills for:
•• Everyday problems.
•• Solving all your life problems.
•• Making your life worth living.

Pros and Cons
Use pros and cons any time you have to decide between two courses of action.

An urge is a crisis when it is very strong and when acting on the urge will make things worse in
the long term.

Make a list of the pros and cons of acting on your crisis urges. These might be to engage in
dangerous, addictive, or harmful behaviors, or they might be to give in, give up, or avoid doing
what is necessary to build a life you want to live.

Make another list of the pros and cons of resisting crisis urges—that is, tolerating the distress
and not giving in to the urges.

Use the grid below to evaluate both sets of pros and cons (this type of grid is also used in

TIP Skills: Changing Your Body Chemistry
To reduce extreme emotion mind fast.
Remember these as TIP skills:
Tip the Temperature of your face with cold water*
(to calm down fast)

T

•• Holding your breath, put your face in a bowl of cold water,
or hold a cold pack (or zip-lock bag of cold water) on your eyes and cheeks.
•• Hold for 30 seconds. Keep water above 50°F.

Intense exercise*
(to calm down your body when it is revved up by emotion)

I

P

•• Engage in intense exercise, if only for a short while.
•• Expend your body’s stored up physical energy by running, walking fast, jumping,
playing basketball, lifting weights, etc.

Paced breathing
(pace your breathing by slowing it down)
•• Breathe deeply into your belly.
•• Slow your pace of inhaling and exhaling way down (on average, five to six breaths
per minute).
•• Breathe out more slowly than you breathe in (for example, 5 seconds in and 7
seconds out).

Paired muscle relaxation
(to calm down by pairing muscle relaxation with breathing out)
•• While breathing into your belly deeply tense your body muscles (not so much as
to cause a cramp).
•• Notice the tension in your body.
•• While breathing out, say the word “Relax” in your mind.
•• Let go of the tension.
•• Notice the difference in your body.

*Caution: Very cold water decreases your heart rate rapidly. Intense exercise will increase heart rate. Consult your health care provider before
using these skills if you have a heart or medical condition, a lowered base heart rate due to medications, take a beta-­blocker, are allergic to
cold, or have an eating disorder.

Using Cold Water, Step by Step
Cold water can work wonders*
When you put your full face into cold water . . . or you put a zip-lock bag
with cold water on your eyes and upper cheeks, and hold your breath, it
tells your brain you are diving underwater.
This causes the “dive response” to occur. (It may take 15–30 seconds to
start.)
Your heart slows down, blood flow to nonessential organs is reduced, and
blood flow is redirected to the brain and heart.
This response can actually help regulate your emotions.
This will be useful as a distress tolerance strategy when you are having
a very strong, distressing emotion, or when you are having very strong
urges to engage in dangerous behaviors.
(This strategy works best when you are sitting quietly—­activity and
distraction may make it less effective.)

Try it out!

*Caution: Very cold water decreases your heart rate. If you have any heart or medical condition, have a lowered base heart rate due to medications, or are on a beta-­blocker, consult your health care provider before using these skills. Avoid ice water if you are allergic to the cold.

Paired Muscle Relaxation, Step by Step
If you have decided to practice paired muscle relaxation, it can be very helpful to practice
relaxing each of your muscles first.
When you are starting, practice in a quiet place to reduce distractions, and make sure that you
have enough time. As you improve with practice, you will want to practice in many different kinds of
places, so that you can relax effectively when you most need to.
Remember that effectiveness improves with practice. If judgments arise, observe them, let
them go, and return to your practice. If you become anxious, try focusing on breathing in to the
count of 5 and out to the count of 7 (or the counts you have already determined for paced breathing),
breathing all the while into your belly until you can return to relaxation exercises.
Now that you are ready to begin . . .
1. Get your body into a comfortable position in which you can relax. Loosen tight clothing. Lie or
sit down, with all body parts uncrossed and no body part supporting any others.
2. For each area of the body listed below, gather tension by tightening muscles. Focus on the
sensation of tightness in and around that area. Hold the tension as you inhale for 5–6 seconds,
then release and breathe out.
3. As you release, say in your mind very slowly the word “Relax.”
4. Observe the changes in sensations as you relax for 10–15 seconds then move on to the next
muscle.
Start first with each of the 16 muscle groups.
Once you can do that, practice with medium groups of muscles and then large groups.
Once you are good at that, practice tensing your entire body at once.

Large
Medium
Small

When you tense your entire body, you are like a robot—stiff, nothing moving.
When you relax your entire body, you are like a rag doll—all muscles drooping down.

Once you can relax all your muscles, practice three or four times a day until you can routinely
relax your entire body rapidly.
By practicing pairing exhaling and the word “Relax” with relaxing your muscles, you will
eventually be able to relax just by letting go and saying the word “Relax.”
Hands and wrists: Make fists with both hands and pull fists up on the wrists.
Lower and upper arms: Make fists and bend both arms up to touch your shoulders.
Shoulders: Pull both shoulders up to your ears.
Forehead: Pull eyebrows close together, wrinkling forehead.
Eyes: Shut eyes tightly.
Nose and upper cheeks: Scrunch up nose; bring upper lips and cheeks up toward eyes.
Lips and lower face: Press lips together; bring edges of lips back toward ears.
Tongue and mouth: Teeth together; tongue pushing on upper mouth.
Neck: Push head back into chair, floor, or bed, or push chin down to chest.
Chest: Take deep breath and hold it.
Back: Arch back, bringing shoulder blades together.
Stomach: Hold stomach in tightly.
Buttocks: Squeeze buttocks together.
Upper legs and thighs: Legs out; tense thighs.
Calves: Legs out; point toes down.
Ankles: Legs out; point toes together, heels out, toes curled under.

Remember, paired relaxation is a skill. It takes time to develop. With practice, you will notice the benefits.

Effective Rethinking and Paired Relaxation,
Step by Step
Stressful
prompting event

What I tell myself

Emotional arousal

Step 1. Write down the prompting event that is often related to distressing emotions and that you
want to work on reducing your emotional reactions to.
Step 2. Ask: “What must I be telling myself (that is, what are my interpretations and thoughts)
about the event that causes such distress and arousal?” Write these down. Examples:
“He hates me,” “I can’t stand this!” “I can’t do this,” “I’ll never make it,” “I’m out of control!”
Step 3. Rethink the situation and its meaning in a way that counteracts the thoughts and interpretations producing stress and distressing emotions. As you rethink the situation, write down as many
effective thoughts as you can to replace the stressful thoughts.
Step 4. When you are not in the stressful prompting event, practice imagining the stressful event:
a. At the same time, while breathing in, say to yourself an effective self-­statement.
b. When breathing out, say “Relax” while intentionally relaxing all your muscles.
Step 5. Keep practicing every chance you get until you have mastered the strategy.
Step 6. When a stressful situation occurs, practice effective rethinking and paired relaxation.

Body Scan Meditation Step by Step
Sit on a chair, or lie on your back on the floor with legs uncrossed. Put your arms in a comfortable
position by your side, on your abdomen, or (if sitting) put them on your thighs palms up. Open your
eyes partially to let light in. If you are lying on the floor, put a cushion under your knees if need
be. Imagine your breath flowing to each part of your body as your attention gently moves up your
body. Adopt a mind of curiosity and interest as you focus on each part of your body.
Focus on your breathing. Notice how the air moves in and out of your body.
•• Take several deep breaths until you begin to feel comfortable and relaxed.
•• Direct your attention to the toes of your left foot.
•• Notice the sensations in that part of your body while remaining aware of your breathing.
•• Imagine each breath flowing to your toes.
•• Looking with curiosity, ask, “What am I feeling in this part of my body?”
•• Focus on your left toes for several minutes.
•• Then move your focus to the arch and heel of your left foot, and hold it there for a minute or
two while continuing to pay attention to your breathing.
•• Notice the sensations on your skin of warmth or coldness; notice the weight of your foot on
the floor.
•• Imagine your breath flowing to the arch and heel of your left foot.
•• Ask, “What are the feelings in the arch and heel of my left foot?”
•• Follow the same procedure as you move to your left ankle, calf, knee, upper legs, and thigh.
•• Repeat with the right leg, starting with your toes.
•• Then move through your pelvis, and lower back, and around to your stomach.
•• Focus on the rising and falling of your belly as your breath goes in and out.
•• Then go on to your chest; left hand, arm, and shoulder; right hand, arm, and shoulder; neck,
chin, tongue, mouth, lips, and lower face; and nose.
•• Notice your breath as it comes in and out of your nostrils.
•• Then focus on your upper cheeks, eyes, forehead, and scalp.
•• Finally, focus on the very top of your hair.
•• Then let go of your body altogether.
Don’t worry if you notice that thoughts, sounds, or other sensations come into your awareness.
Just notice them and then gently refocus your mind. Don’t worry if your mind has been drawn away
from the object of your attention and you find yourself thinking about something else (it nearly
always happens). Just calmly, gently, but with resolution, turn your mind back to the part of the body
you’ve reached. You may need to bring your attention back over and over. You are not alone in this.
It is this bringing of your attention back over and over and over, without judgment or harshness, that
is the essential element of the meditation.

Radical Acceptance
(When you cannot keep painful events and emotions from coming your way.)

What Is Radical Acceptance?
1. Radical means all the way, complete and total.
2. It is accepting in your mind, your heart, and your body.
3. It’s when you stop fighting reality, stop throwing tantrums because reality is not
the way you want it, and let go of bitterness.

What Has to Be Accepted?
1. Reality is as it is (the facts about the past and the present are the facts, even if
you don’t like them).
2. There are limitations on the future for everyone (but only realistic limitations need
to be accepted).
3. Everything has a cause (including events and situations that cause you pain and
suffering).
4. Life can be worth living even with painful events in it.

Why Accept Reality?
1. Rejecting reality does not change reality.
2. Changing reality requires first accepting reality.
3. Pain can’t be avoided; it is nature’s way of signaling that something is wrong.
4. Rejecting reality turns pain into suffering.
5. Refusing to accept reality can keep you stuck in unhappiness, bitterness, anger,
sadness, shame, or other painful emotions.
6. Acceptance may lead to sadness, but deep calmness usually follows.
7. The path out of hell is through misery. By refusing to accept the misery that is
part of climbing out of hell, you fall back into hell.

Radical Acceptance: Factors That Interfere

Radical Acceptance Is Not:
Approval, compassion, love, passivity, or against change.

Factors That Interfere with Acceptance

1. You don’t have the skills for acceptance; you do not know
how to accept really painful events and facts.

2. You believe that if you accept a painful event, you are
making light of it or are approving of the facts, and that
nothing will be done to change or prevent future painful
events.

3. Emotions get in the way (unbearable sadness; anger at
the person or group that caused the painful event; rage at
the injustice of the world; overwhelming shame about who
you are; guilt about your own behavior).

Practicing Radical Acceptance Step by Step

Observe that you are questioning or fighting reality (“It shouldn’t be this way”).

Remind yourself that the unpleasant reality is just as it is and cannot be changed (“This is what
happened”).

Remind yourself that there are causes for the reality. Acknowledge that some sort of history led
up to this very moment. Consider how people’s lives have been shaped by a series of factors.
Notice that given these causal factors and how history led up to this moment, this reality had to
occur just this way (“This is how things happened”).

Practice accepting with the whole self (mind, body, and spirit). Be creative in finding ways
to involve your whole self. Use accepting self-talk—but also consider using relaxation;
mindfulness of your breath; half-­smiling and willing hands while thinking about what feels
unacceptable; prayer; going to a place that helps bring you to acceptance; or imagery.

Practice opposite action. List all the behaviors you would do if you did accept the facts. Then
act as if you have already accepted the facts. Engage in the behaviors that you would do if you
really had accepted.

Cope ahead with events that seem unacceptable. Imagine (in your mind’s eye) believing what
you don’t want to accept. Rehearse in your mind what you would do if you accepted what
seems unacceptable.

Attend to body sensations as you think about what you need to accept.

Allow disappointment, sadness, or grief to arise within you.

Acknowledge that life can be worth living even when there is pain.

Do pros and cons if you find yourself resisting practicing acceptance.

Turning the Mind
Turning the mind is like facing a fork in the road. You
have to turn your mind toward the acceptance road, and
away from the road of rejecting reality.
Turning the mind is choosing to accept.
The choice to accept does not itself equal acceptance.
It just puts you on the path.

Turning the Mind, Step by Step
1. Observe that you are not accepting.
(Look for anger, bitterness, annoyance;
avoiding emotions; saying “Why me?”,
“Why is this happening?”, “I can’t stand
this,” “It shouldn’t be this way.”)

Rejection

Acceptance

If you are here . . .

2. Go within yourself and make an
inner commitment to accept reality
as it is.
3. Do it again, over and over. Keep
turning your mind to acceptance each
time you come to the fork in the road
where you can reject reality or accept it.
4. Develop a plan for catching yourself
in the future when you drift out of
acceptance.

Willingness
Willingness is readiness to enter and participate fully in life and living.
Find a willing response to each situation.
Willingness is doing just what is needed:
•• In each situation.
•• Wholeheartedly, without dragging your feet.
Willingness is listening very carefully to your Wise Mind, and then
acting from your Wise Mind.
Willingness is acting with awareness that you are connected
to the universe (to the stars, people you like and don’t like, the floor,
etc.).

Replace willfulness with willingness.
•• Willfulness is refusing to tolerate the moment.
•• Willfulness is refusing to make changes that are needed.
•• Willfulness is giving up.
•• Willfulness is the opposite of “doing what works.”
•• Willfulness is trying to fix every situation.
•• Willfulness is insisting on being in control.
•• Willfulness is attachment to “me, me, me” and “what I want
right now!”

Willingness, Step by Step
1. Observe the willfulness. Label it. Experience it.
2. Radically accept that at this moment you feel (and may be
acting) willful. You cannot fight willfulness with willfulness.
3. Turn your mind toward acceptance and willingness.
4. Try half-­smiling and a willing posture.
5. When willfulness is immovable, ask, “What’s the threat?”

Half-­Smiling and Willing Hands
Accepting reality with your body.
Half-­Smiling
1st. Relax your face from the top of your head down to your chin and jaw.
Let go of each facial muscle (forehead, eyes, and brows; cheeks,
mouth, and tongue; teeth slightly apart). If you have difficulty, try
tensing your facial muscles and then letting go.
A tense smile is a grin (and might tell your brain you are hiding or
masking your real feelings).
2nd. Let both corners of your lips go slightly up, just so you can feel them.
It is not necessary for others to see it. A half-smile is slightly
upturned lips with a relaxed face.
3rd. Try to adopt a serene facial expression.
Remember, your face communicates to your brain; your body
connects to your mind.

Willing Hands
Standing:

Drop your arms down from your shoulders; keep them
straight or bent slightly at the elbows. With hands
unclenched, turn your hands outward, with thumbs out to
your sides, palms up, and fingers relaxed.

Sitting:

Place your hands on your lap or your thighs. With hands
unclenched, turn your hands outward, with palms up and
fingers relaxed.

Lying down:

Arms by your side, hands unclenched, turn your palms
up with fingers relaxed.

Remember, your hands communicate to your brain; your body connects to
your mind.

before you get out of bed to take hold of your breath. Inhale and exhale three breaths gently
while maintaining a half-smile. Follow your breaths. Add willing hands to your half-smile, or
practice willing hands alone.
2. Half-smile during your free moments.
Anywhere you find yourself sitting or standing, half-smile. Look at a child, a leaf, a painting on a
wall, or anything that is relatively still, and smile. Inhale and exhale quietly three times.
3. Half-smile with willing hands while you are listening to music.
Listen to a piece of music for 2 or 3 minutes. Pay attention to the words, music, rhythm, and
sentiments of the music you are listening to (not your daydreams of other times). Half-smile
while watching your inhalations and exhalations. Adopt a willing-hands posture.
4. Half-smile with willing hands when you are irritated.
When you realize “I’m irritated,” half-smile or adopt a willing-hands posture at once. Inhale and
exhale quietly, maintaining a half-smile or willing hands for three breaths.
5. Half-smile in a lying-down position.
Lie on your back on a flat surface, without the support of mattress or pillow. Keep your two arms
loosely by your sides, and keep your two legs slightly apart, stretched out before you. Maintain
willing hands and a half-smile. Breathe in and out gently, keeping your attention focused on
your breath. Let go of every muscle in your body. Relax each muscle as though it were sinking
down through the floor, or as though it were as soft and yielding as a piece of silk hanging in
the breeze to dry. Let go entirely, keeping your attention only on your breath and half-smile.
Think of yourself as a cat, completely relaxed before a warm fire, whose muscles yield without
resistance to anyone’s touch. Continue for 15 breaths.
6. Half-smile in a sitting position.
Sit on the floor with your back straight, or on a chair with your two feet touching the floor. Halfsmile. Inhale and exhale while maintaining the half-smile. Let go.

7. Half-smile with willing hands while you are contemplating a person
you dislike or are angry with.
•• Sit quietly. Breathe and smile a half-smile. Hold your hands open with palms up.
•• Imagine the image of the person who has caused you suffering.
•• Regard the features you dislike the most or find the most repulsive.
•• Try to examine what makes this person happy and what causes suffering in his or her
daily life.
•• Imagine the person’s perceptions; try to see what patterns of thought and reason this
person follows.
•• Examine what motivates this person’s hopes and actions.
•• Finally, consider the person’s consciousness. See whether the person’s views and
insights are open and free or not, and whether or not the person has been influenced by
any prejudices, narrow-­mindedness, hatred, or anger.
•• See whether or not the person is master of him- or herself.
•• Continue until you feel compassion rise in your heart like a well filling with fresh water,
and your anger and resentment disappear. Practice this exercise many times on the
same person.

Mindfulness of Current Thoughts
1. Observe your thoughts.
•• As waves, coming and going.
•• Not suppressing thoughts.
•• Not judging thoughts.
•• Acknowledging their presence.
•• Not keeping thoughts around.

•• Not analyzing thoughts.
•• Practicing willingness.
•• Stepping back and observing
thoughts as they run in and out of
your mind.

2. Adopt a curious mind.
•• Ask, “Where do my thoughts come from?” Watch and see.
•• Notice that every thought that comes also goes out of your mind.
•• Observe but do not evaluate your thoughts. Let go of judgments.

3. Remember: You are not your thoughts.
•• Do not necessarily act on thoughts.
•• Remember times when you have had very different thoughts.
•• Remind yourself that catastrophic thinking is “emotion mind.”
•• Remember how you think when you are not feeling such intense suffering
and pain.

4. Don’t block or suppress thoughts.
•• Ask, “What sensations are these thoughts trying to avoid?” Turn your mind
to the sensation. Then come back to the thought. Repeat several times.
•• Step back; allow your thoughts to come and go as you observe your breath.
•• Play with your thoughts: Repeat them out loud over and over as fast as
you can. Sing them. Imagine the thoughts as the words of a clown, as
recordings getting all tangled up; as cute animals you can cuddle up to; as
bright colors running through your mind; as only sounds.
•• Try loving your thoughts.

Practicing Mindfulness of Thoughts
Practice Mindfulness of Thoughts by Observing Them
1. Notice thoughts as they come into your mind. As a thought comes into your mind, say
“a thought has entered my mind.” Label the thought as a thought, saying, “The thought
[describe thought] arose in my mind.” Use a gentle voice tone.
2. As you notice thoughts in your mind, ask, “Where did the thought come from?” Then watch
your mind to see if you can see where it came from.
3. Step back from your mind, as if you are on top of a mountain and your mind is just a boulder
down below. Gaze at your mind, watching what thoughts come up when you are watching it.
Come back into your mind before you stop.
4. Close your eyes and scan your body for the first physical sensation that you notice. Then
scan your mind for the first thought you notice. Shuttle back and forth between scanning for
physical sensations and scanning for thoughts. Another time, replace scanning your body
for physical sensations to scanning yourself for any emotional feelings. Then shuttle back
and forth between an emotional feeling and a thought.

Practice Mindfulness of Thoughts by Using Words and Voice Tone
5. Verbalize thoughts or beliefs out loud, using a nonjudgmental voice tone, over and over and
over:

As fast as you can until the thoughts make no sense.

Very, very slowly (one syllable or word per breath).

In a different voice from yours (high- or low-­pitched, like a cartoon character or celebrity).

As a dialogue on a TV comedy show (“You’ll never believe what thought went through
my mind. I was thinking, ‘I’m a jerk.’ Can you believe that?”).

As songs, sung wholeheartedly and dramatically, in a tune that fits the thoughts.

Practice Mindfulness of Thoughts with Opposite Action
6. Relax your face and body while imagining accepting your thoughts as only thoughts—­
sensations of the brain.
7. Imagine things you would do if you stopped believing everything you think.
8. Rehearse in your mind the things that you would do if you did not view your thoughts as
facts.
9. Practice loving your thoughts as they go through your mind.

Practice Mindfulness of Thoughts by Imagining That Your Mind Is:

10. A conveyor belt, and that thoughts and feelings are coming down the belt. Put each thought
or feeling in a box labeled with the type of thought that it is (e.g., worry thoughts, thoughts
about my past, thoughts about my mother, planning what to do thoughts). Just keep
observing and sorting thoughts into the labeled boxes.

11. A river, and that thoughts and feelings are boats going down the river. Imagine sitting on the
grass, watching the boats go by. Try not to jump on the boat.

12. A railroad track, and that thoughts and feelings are train cars going by. Try not to jump on
the train.

13. A leaf that has dropped off a tree into a beautiful creek flowing by you as you sit on the
grass. Each time a thought or image comes into your mind, imagine that it is written or
pictured on the leaf floating by. Let each leaf go by, watching as it goes out of sight.

14. The sky, and thoughts have wings and can fly through the sky. Watch as each flies out of
sight.

15. The sky, and thoughts are clouds. Notice each thought-cloud as it drifts by, letting it drift out
of your mind.

16. A white room with two doors. Through one door, thoughts come in; through the other,
thoughts go out. Watch each thought with attention and curiosity until it leaves. Let go of
judgments. Let go of analyzing thoughts and of figuring out if they fit the facts. As a thought
comes into your mind, say, “A thought has entered my mind.”

Dialectical Abstinence

ABSTINENCE
(Swearing off
addictive behavior)

vs.

Pro: People who commit to
abstinence stay off longer.
Con: It takes longer for people
to get back “on the wagon”
once they fall off.

HARM REDUCTION
(Acknowledging there will be
slips; minimizing the damage,
but not demanding perfection)
Pro: When a slip does happen,
people can get back “on the
wagon” faster.
Con: People who commit to
harm reduction relapse quicker.

Synthesis = Dialectical Abstinence
The goal is not to engage in addictive behavior again—
in other words, to achieve complete abstinence.
However, if there is a slip, the goal is to minimize harm
and get back to abstinence as soon as possible.
Pros: It works!
Cons: It’s work. You don’t get a vacation.
(You’re always either abstinent or working to get back to abstinence.)
An example of expecting the best and planning for the trouble spots:
Olympic athletes must believe and behave as though they can win
every race, even though they have lost before and will lose again.

asking for help from family, friends, sponsors, ministers, or counselors,
can also be helpful. If you are isolated, help can often be found via online
support groups.
Conduct a chain analysis to analyze what prompted the lapse (General

Community Reinforcement
Community reinforcement means replacing addiction reinforcers
with abstinence reinforcers.

Reinforcing Abstinence Is Critical
Reinforcers in your environment play a powerful role in encouraging or discouraging addictive
behaviors.
To stop addictive behavior, you have to figure out how to make a lifestyle without your
addictive behaviors more rewarding than a lifestyle with your addictive behaviors.
You have to find a way to get behaviors incompatible with addictions to pay off and be
rewarded by those around you.
Willpower is not sufficient. If it were, we would all be perfect!

Replace Addiction Reinforcers with Abstinence Reinforcers
Begin a series of action steps that will increase your chances of accumulating positive events
to replace addictive behavior.

Search for people to spend time with who aren’t addicted.

Increase the number of enjoyable activities you engage in that do not involve your
addiction.

If you cannot decide what people or activities you like, sample a lot of different groups of
people and a lot of different activities.

Abstinence Sampling

Commit to    days off your addiction, and observe the benefits that naturally occur.

Temporarily avoid high-risk addiction triggers, and replace these with competing behaviors
to get you through the sampling period.

Observe all the extra positive events occurring when you are not engaging in addictive
behaviors.

Burning Bridges and Building New Ones
Burning Bridges
Accept at the most radical level that you are not going to engage in addictive behavior
again, and then move actively to cut off all addictive behavior options.

1. Make an absolute commitment to abstinence from the addictive behavior, which is
           (describe addictive behavior). Then walk into the garage of
abstinence and slam the garage door shut. (Remember that the tiniest slit of space
can let an entire elephant in.)

2. List everything in your life that makes addiction possible.

3. Get rid of these things:

Throw out contact information of people who collude with you.

Get rid of all possible cues and temptations.

4. List and do everything you can that will make it hard or impossible to continue your
addictive behavior.

Ruthlessly and at every moment, tell the truth about your behavior.

Tell all your friends and family that you have quit.

Building New Bridges
Create visual images and smells that will compete with the information loaded into
your visual and olfactory brain systems when cravings occur.
Cravings and urges are strongly related to vivid images and smells of what is craved. The stronger the imagery or smell, the stronger the craving.

Build different images or smells to think about. Try to keep these images or smells
in memory when you have an unwanted craving. For example, whenever you crave
a cigarette, imagine being on the beach; see and smell it in your mind to reduce the
craving.

When you have unwanted cravings, look at moving images or surround yourself with
smells unrelated to the addiction. Moving images and new smells will compete with your
cravings.

“Urge-surf” by imagining yourself on a surfboard riding the waves of your urges. Notice
them coming and going, rising high, going low, and finally going away.

Alternate Rebellion and Adaptive Denial
Alternate Rebellion
When addictive behaviors are a way to rebel against authority, conventions, and the boredom
of not breaking rules or laws, try alternate rebellion. Alternate rebellion replaces destructive
rebellion and keeps you on a path to your goals.
Examples:

Shave your head.

Wear crazy underwear.

Wear unmatched shoes.

Have secret thoughts.

Express unpopular views.

Do random acts of kindness.

Vacation with your family at a nudist colony.

Write a letter saying exactly what you want to.


Dye your hair a wild color.

Get a tattoo or body piercing.

Wear clothes inside out.

Don’t bathe for a week.

Print a slogan on a t-shirt.

Paint your face.

Dress up or dress down where
doing so is unexpected.

Adaptive Denial
When your mind can’t tolerate craving for addictive behaviors, try adaptive denial.

Give logic a break when you are doing this. Don’t argue with yourself.

When urges hit, deny that you want the problem behavior or substance. Convince yourself
you want something other than the problem behavior. For example, reframe an urge to
have a cigarette as an urge to have a flavored toothpick; an urge to have alcohol as an
urge to have something sweet; or an urge to gamble as an urge to alternate rebellion (see
above).
Other: 	                       
Other: 	                       
Be adamant with yourself in your denial, and engage in the alternative behavior.

Put off addictive behavior. Put it off for 5 minutes, then put it off for another 5 minutes, and
so on and on, each time saying, “I only have to stand this for 5 minutes.” By telling yourself
each day you will be abstinent for today (or each hour for just this hour, and so on), you are
saying, “This is not forever. I can stand this right now.”
